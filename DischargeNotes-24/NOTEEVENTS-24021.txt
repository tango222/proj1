History of Present Illness:
53 yo F with diastolic CHF, CAD, DM, Hep C, presents with 
progressive dyspnea on exertion and chest pain.  The patient has 
been having progressive dyspnea over the past 3-4 weeks.  The 
symptoms are worsened by even mild activity such as sweeping the 
floor.  She also has been having intermittent L chest pain with 
out radiation or diaphoresis.  This pain worsens with activity 
and improves with rest.  Furthermore the patient has been having 
a productive cough with brown sputum.  Patient is a difficult 
historian.
.
Denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  Reports no 
change in her chronic abdominal pain or chronic orthopnea.  
Patient speaks slowly with a flat affect.
.
In the ED patient was given 60mg IV lasix, levoflox 500mg IV.

Agree with Nightfloat admission note. The patient is not able to 
provide a fully consistent history. She mentions feeling more 
ill over the past several weeks, which has included increased 
SOB as well as intermittent chest pain. She believes the CP 
radiates to both arms is described as sharp rather than 
sqeezing. She has noted increased SOB when performing her daily 
activities, she is highly sedentery recently, no stairs or walks 
outside of the home. She is currently chest pain free. No 
fevers, chills, no cough or wheezing.

1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is 
elongated.  
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular cavity 
is unusually small. Left ventricular cavity size could not be 
determined. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.]  
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular 
systolic  
function is normal. Abnormal septal position consistent with RV  

pressure/volume overload.  
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) 
aortic  
regurgitation is seen.  
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
moderate mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen.  
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.  
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  
8.There is no pericardial effusion 

[**2931-4-13**] Stress Test
This 53 year old type 2 IDDM woman was referred to 
the lab for evaluation of chest discomfort and shortness of 
breath. Due 
to PVD, the patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of 
dipyridamole 
over 4 minutes. No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was 
reported by 
the patient throughout the study. There were no ST segment 
changes 
during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with 
frequent 
isolated vpbs. Appropriate hemodynamc response to the infusion. 
The 
dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV. 
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. 
Nuclear 
report sent separately. 

[**2931-4-16**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a co-dominanat system 
with 
calcified Left Main Coronary Artery. The LAD had a 50% 
mid-vessel hazy 
lesion. LCX had a severe 90% lesion at its origin and a 50% OM 
lesion. 
RCA was chronically totally occluded proximally but was a 
smaller vessel 
with an acute marginal branch and modest L->R collaterals. 
2. Left ventriculography showed preserved ejection fraction 
(58%) which 
is depressed given the degree of mitral regurgitation (3+). 
Inferior 
wall was hypokinetic. 
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed a 9 mmhg gradient across the 
mitral 
valve consistent with moderate mitral stenosis. There was no 
gradient 
across the aortic valve. Pulmonary pressures were moderately to 
severely 
elevated with Pap 85/38. PCWP was 35 mm Hg. 

[**2931-4-21**] CXR
Right internal jugular vascular sheath remains in standard 
position. There is stable postoperative widening of the cardiac 
and mediastinal contours. Vascular engorgement and perihilar 
haziness is again demonstrated. Bibasilar atelectasis and 
pleural effusions, small on the left and moderate on the right 
are without change. Overall, there has not been a significant 
change allowing for technical differences.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 4405**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 25**] on [**2931-4-12**] for evaluation 
of chest discomfort and dyspnea. A stress test was performed 
which was normal however the nuclear images revealed a 
reversible defect in the left anterior descending artery 
territory. Plavix was started and her lipitor was increased. 
Lasix and an ace inhibitor were started for congestive heart 
failure symptoms. She developed another episode of chest pain 
which suggested the possibility of unstable angina. A cardiac 
catheterization was performed which was significant for three 
vessel coronary artery disease, mixed mitral valve stenosis and 
regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. An 
echocardiogram was performed which showed a dilated left atrium, 
a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, 1+ aortic 
regurgitation, moderate mitral valve stenosis, moderate mitral 
valve regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Heparin 
was started and her plavix was stopped. Given these findings, 
the cardiac surgery service was consulted for surgical 
evaluation. Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 4405**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative 
manner. On [**2931-4-19**], Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 4405**] was taken to the operating room 
where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two 
vessels and a mitral valve replacement with a 25mm mosaic 
porcine valve. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac 
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. She had a short run 
of ventricular tachycardia which was self limited. On 
postoperative day one, Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 4405**] awoke neurologically intact 
and was extubated. Methadone was resumed given her history of 
heroin abuse. Beta blockade, statin therapy and aspirin were 
started. On postoperative day two, she was transferred to the 
cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. She was 
gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The physical 
therapy service was consulted for assistance with her 
postoperative strength and mobility. Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 4405**] continued to 
make steady progress and was discharged to her home with a 
visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4406**] day five. She will follow-up 
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 394**], her cardiologist and her primary care physician 
as an outpatient.
