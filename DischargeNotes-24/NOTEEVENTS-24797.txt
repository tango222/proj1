     INDICATION: 55 y/o man found unconscious with low grade fever. R/O acute
     cardiopulmonary abnormality.
     
     AP SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Radiograph is extremely limited due to patient's
     position and motion. The heart appears to be within normal limits. The
     mediastinum cannot be assessed due to rotation of the patient. There is no
     evidence of pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pleural effusions. However,
     the right costophrenic angle is not included in the radiograph. No obvious
     consolidations were identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) There is no radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
     However, the radiograph is extremely limited due to rotation, and patient
     motion. Recommend whenever possible to repeat the PA & lateral chest
     radiograph if clinically indicated.
     2) There are no obvious rib fractures.

Admission Date:  [**2995-5-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2995-5-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2939-5-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old male with
a past medical history significant for end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis, Hepatitis C, and Hepatitis B,
hypertension, poly-substance abuse found down, on admission
here with a finger stick of 68.  The patient was unable to
provide any history on presentation.  The patient was
unintelligible and flailing limbs in the Emergency
Department.  Temperature was 100.2 F., and more than 103.0 F.
rectally in the Emergency Department with systolic blood
pressure of 200 and with heart rate in the 120s.  The
patient's labs were notable for a creatinine of 6.2; no urine
output when Foley catheter was placed.  He had arterial blood
gas of 7.51, 44, 74.

A lumbar puncture was performed, showing 6 white blood cells
with 93% neutrophils and 31 red blood cells; no organisms on
Gram Stain.

The patient received ceftriaxone 2 grams, Vancomycin 1 gram
and a total of 6 mg of Ativan and 5 mg of Haldol, Tylenol and
the patient was admitted to FICU secondary to unstable oxygen
saturation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Obtained from [**Hospital6 1097**].
1.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
2.  Chronic anemia, secondary to renal disease.  Baseline
hematocrit of 28 to 32.
3.  Chronic thrombocytopenia, baseline platelets between 70
to 80.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hepatitis B and C.
6.  Myocardial infarction at age 21.
7.  Peripheral vascular disease.
8.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm 3.9 cm measured in [**2994-12-1**].
9.  Status post appendectomy.
10. Cholelithiasis.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Nephrocaps one capsule p.o. q. day.
2.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Sevelamer 400 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Docusate 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Percocet p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.4 F.;
blood pressure 134/75; heart rate ranging between 91 to 126;
respiratory rate 18; O2 saturation 92% on room air.  The
patient was a confused, cachectic, combative male.  Pupils
about 3 mm.  There is a question of being unreactive.  Unable
to assess oral cavity.  Neck is difficult to examination with
a question of stiffness.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate, S1, S2, no murmur.  Belly
is soft, nontender, nondistended; positive bowel sounds.  Has
several old scars.  Rectal examination is guaiac positive.
Extremities have left fistula with thrill and bruit and has a
right surgical incision oozing serosanguinous fluid and
indurated.  Neurologic examination was difficult as the
patient was uncooperative, somnolent, but easily aroused,
agitated, nonverbal, moving all four extremities.  Strength
intact; three plus reflexes throughout.  No clonus.  Toes
were downward.

LABORATORY:  On admission, pertinent labs included white
blood cell count 11.1, hematocrit 32.4, platelets 95, MCV of
103.  Chem-10 was sodium of 139, potassium 4.7, chloride 92;
bicarbonate 25, BUN 11, creatinine 6.2, glucose 100, anion
gap of 22, INR of 1.1.  CK 107, troponin 0.03.

Serum toxicology was negative.

The patient had an EKG showing sinus tachycardia at 122;
normal axis and intervals.  Has left ventricular hypertrophy
by voltage, one to two mm ST depression in V4 through V6 and
II.  No Qs.

Chest x-ray was clear but has motion artifacts.

MRI of the head on [**5-3**], showing chronic microvascular
infarction; no acute infarction.  CT scan of the head on [**5-2**], was negative for hemorrhage.  His white matter change was
consistent with microvascular angiopathy.

The patient had an echocardiogram done on [**5-5**] showing
there is a mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and
overall left ventricular systolic function is normal.  Left
ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  Mild aortic
regurgitation and trivial mitral regurgitation.  No evidence
of endocarditis seen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Differential diagnosis including
syncope, seizures, stroke, HSV encephalitis, alcohol
withdrawal or illicit drug use.  The patient improved back to
his baseline after staying in the Intensive Care Unit for two
days and then was transferred to the floor.  Both CT scan and
MRI of the head showing old infarction; no acute hemorrhage
or infarction.  Given his history of poly-substance abuse,
this could be from the drug use, although the serum
toxicology was negative.  The lumbar puncture was negative
for bacterial culture and viral culture and later returned
also negative.  The patient was originally started on
Acyclovir due to suspicion of possible HSV infection,
encephalitis and was discharged after viral culture returned
to be negative.

2.  RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  The patient has [**Street Address 1421**]
depression V4 through V6 and II, but has three sets of stable
CK and troponin.  The echocardiogram showed normal left
ventricular function with only one plus AR and trivial mitral
regurgitation; otherwise unremarkable.

3.  GUAIAC POSITIVE STOOL:  The patient had a hematocrit drop
slightly below 25 from a baseline of 28.  Was transfused with
one unit of packed red blood cells.  We recommend outpatient
endoscopy and colonoscopy.  Given that the patient is a
regular [**Hospital6 1097**] patient, it would be more
beneficial for him to go to the [**Hospital6 1097**] system
so the record will stay there.

4.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON HEMODIALYSIS:  He has received
hemodialysis on Monday and Wednesday during his hospital
stay.

5.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA OF UNKNOWN CAUSE:  This has been a
chronic problem for the patient.  At discharge, platelet
level is 78.

6.  ANEMIA:  The patient has chronic anemia secondary to
end-stage renal disease.  Iron studies are consistent with
anemia of chronic disease.  Has normal folate and B12 levels.
Will just continue monitoring and transfuse if less than 25.

7.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient's blood pressure was on the
higher end and only on Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q. day.  Will
recommend him to add another [**Doctor Last Name 978**].  His primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6057**], was notified by his nurse in the
Gambriel Dialysis Center.  The patient had a high blood
pressure while in the hospital and recommend monitoring and
adding another [**Doctor Last Name 978**] for better control of his blood
pressure.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Syncope.
2.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
6.  Poly-substance abuse.
7.  Hepatitis B and C.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Vitals stable, ambulating, eating.
