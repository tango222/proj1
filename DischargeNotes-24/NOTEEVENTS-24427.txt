     Reason: GI BLEED

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  GI bleed.
     
     ABDOMEN, ONE VIEW:  Supine view, without comparison.  Nasogastric tube is seen
     coiling in the stomach.  Air is seen throughout the bowel, with dilatation of
     the entire small bowel in a pattern that suggests ileus.  Intramural air is
     suggested, consistent with the patient's known history of diffuse pneumatosis
     intestinalis on outside CT scan.  There are degenerative changes of the spine.
     Free air is not identified on this supine view.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bowel dilatation along with patient's known pneumatosis
     intestinalis is concerning for mesenteric ischemia.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      67 year old man with ischemic bowel intubated                                   
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ?tube placment

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  67-year-old man with ischemic bowel, status post intubation.
     Evaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  An endotracheal tube is positioned less than
     1 mm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach
     fundus.  The right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There
     is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
     mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
     Opacification at the left lung base is consistent with atelectasis.  The right
     lung is clear.  The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Endotracheal tube less than 1 cm above the carina.
     2.  No pneumothorax.
     3.  Left lower lobe collapse and consolidation, most consistent with
     atelectasis.
