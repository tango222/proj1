Brief Hospital Course:
  
1. Respiratory failure -- Initially intubated at an OSH, Mrs. 
[**Known patient lastname 6329**] proved difficult to extubate because of poor oxygenation 
related to large bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.  Given 
her low EF, this was first felt to be related to pulmonary 
edema, however, when these continue to worsen despite adequate 
diuresis, an infectious source became the prime suspect.  
Because of her history of cough/myalgias, she underwent nasal 
washings for the flu and was put on droplet precautions; the DFA 
came back positive, and per ID's reccomendations, oseltamivir 
was begun.  Given her functionally neutropenic state, cefepime 
and vancomycin also were initiated for a possible bacterial 
process, with azithromycin added later for atypicals.  She 
spiked a temperature to 104 the first night, but all cultures 
failed to grow.  Although afebrile following this, her 
temperature curve could not be interpreted due to steroids given 
in stress-dosing.
On this antimicrobial regimen along with diuresis, her sats 
intially improved, and she was able to be extubated.  However, 
the following day her steroids were stopped and she became 
increasingly tachypneic and re-spiked a temperature.  Her chest 
x-ray showed progression of the infiltrate and she wae 
re-intubated, primarily for bronchoscopy.  She was unable to be 
weaned off the ventilator, and eventually developed pulmonary 
changes consistent with end-stage ARDS/fibrosis.  She was 
started on steroids, and remained intubated.  After 2 weeks on 
steroids repeat CXR should slight improvement of diffuse 
infiltrates.  Her ventilatory settings were gradually weaned and 
she was able to tolerate PS with minimal pressures and PEEP.  
She was tolerating PS for 24 hour periods at a time.   
Unfortunatley she had an event of hemoptysis in which she 
desaturated into the 70's and required increase vent support.  
Two felx bronchs were done which could not identify a focal 
source for the bleeding.  She only lost a small amount of blood 
and ultimately it was felt to be caused by aggressive 
suctioning.  After this event she had no further hemoptysis 
however she required AC on the vent.  Attempts were made to try 
PS but the patient only lasted 15 minutes or so before tired.  
Also around this time she developed fevers and bacteremia.  It 
was then decided to hold off any attempts at weaning and keep 
the patient on full vent support until she cleared the 
infections and was afebrile.  CXR during this period showed 
persistent signs of ARDS with no improvement in lungs on CXR. 

The patient had increasing respiratory distress from [**2697-3-20**] 
onward and became increasingly difficult to ventilate with 
worseining CXR on full coverage of antimicrobial agents. In 
addition, she required three pressors support over the period 
from [**Date range (1) 6330**]. The decision was made by the family to withdraw 
pressors on [**2-25**]. She died within hours. 

2. Blast crisis -- Most likely AML.  She was intially 
leukopheresed, bringing her WBC down from 60,000 to 30,000 and 
was started on hydroxyurea and allopurinol.  DIC and tumor lysis 
labs were followed every six hours but remained negative.  More 
definitive chemotherapy was initially put on hold given her poor 
respiratory function/infection (as described below) and her 
initial echo with and EF of 30%.  Her counts continued to drop 
while on hydrea, until eventually it was discontinued.  She was 
transfused multiple times to keep her Plt > 10 and Hct > 20, 
eventually having a minimal response to transfusions.  DAT was 
positive for anti-SDH, which according to the blood bank, was 
not enough to account for what would have been the degree of 
hemolysis needed for the lack of response. Oncology determined 
that the patient was too ill to begin chemotherapy; her WBC 
eventually decreased to consistently below 1000 total.  She 
remained neutropenic for 2-3 weeks then as she improved her WBC 
began to slowly rise again.  She had a period where she was 
non-neutropenic for about 7 days during whichc she was afebrile 
and off of antibiotics.  Also noted during this period was that 
she had no blasts in her peripheral blood samples.  Thus it was 
decided to re check a bone marrow biopsy to determine if the 
patient had AML or more of a MDS picture.  Bone marrow biopsy 
demonstrated 20% blasts indicative of AML.  After being 
non-neutropenic for 7 days or so her counts began to drop at 
which point it was discovered she had VRE and MRSA bactermia.  
Also she now had blasts back in her peripheral blood.  At this 
point from heme/onc position the patient would require induction 
chemotherapy to induce remission and then the only curative 
measure would be BMT.  However given the patients condition this 
was not an option as she would not survive chemotherapy given 
her state of health.  Discussion was held with the family and 
goal was for patient to go to rehab with possibilities of 
regaining her strength their and maybe at some point down the 
line she may be strong enough to go through chemo.  

3. Anisochoria -- Noted on the first morning of admission, the 
patient's anisochoria manifested as a dilated right pupil that 
was sluggishly reactive as compared to a smaller, reactive left 
pupil.  This finding was [**Location (un) **] out in both bright and dim light 
and was clearly different from her admission physical exam.  A 
stat head CT was obtained without obvious abnormalities and 
neurology was consulted.  An MRI additionally failed to provide 
and explanation, and ultimately, it was felt that this was due 
to the disease process, possibly a leukemic infiltrate. She was 
given intrathecal methotrexate empirically, followed by 
intrathecal cytarabine.  On CT she was also noted to have 
splenic infarcts; however, her other respiratory and infectious 
problems prevented any further workup for possible infiltrative 
disease.    

4. Elevated LFTs -- Present upon admission, the top two theories 
were alcholic hepatitis versus leukemic infiltration.  She had 
an ultrasound that showed findings consistent with fatty liver 
disease and a solitary nodule.  Hepatitis panels were negative.  
Her LFT's remained stable but elevated, and CT showed liver 
disease, which would have required MRI or biopsy; however, other 
clinical problems prevented further workup.  Her LFT's remained 
slightly eleavted with high ALT, TBili, Alk phos.  These were 
monitored and remained unchanged.  RUQ uUS showed no evidence of 
cholecystitis but she did have a thickened GB fundus indicative 
of possible adenomyomatosis.  This will need to be followed up 
after d/c from the hospital.  Otherwise she had no specific abd 
complaints and her labs were followed.

5. ID: The patient had a positive DFA, and was started on 
tamiflu empirically.  She was also then started on amantadine 
empirically.  She underwent several BALs during the admission, 
which were all negative for everything except influenza A--the 
final one was negative for the flu.  She was started on broad 
spectrum antibiotics for frequent fevers.  She was also started 
on ambisome, which was discontinued due to renal failure; then 
caspofungin, which was changed to voriconazole due to concerns 
for cholestasis.  Blood cultures from her RSC line grew VRE, for 
which she was treated with 14 days of daptomycin.  She was 
continued on imipenem and voriconazole empirically for febrile 
neutropenia.  Galactomannan and histoplasma antigen were both 
negative.  Pt was then on imipenem and voriconazole for several 
weeks while she was neutropenic.  Her counts gradually came up 
and she remained afebrile.  After she was non-neutropenic for 
several days and afebrile the imipenem and voriconazole were 
removed.  She was off antibiotics for at least seven days.  Then 
her counts dropped again and she developed fevers.  Bld cultures 
initially grew out VRE.  So she was restarted on daptomycin, and 
 cefepime was added as well for fever of neutropenia.   Her 
central line was removed and changed to PICC line however she 
then developed MRSA in her bld cultures.  This was a high grade 
bacteremia with multiple cultures coming back positive.  She was 
continued on the daptomycin which will cover both VRE and MRSA.  
All central lines were removed and she was converted to PIV's, 
giving her a central access holiday.  She continued to spike and 
was found to have sparce growth of aspergillus in her sputum.  
Galactomannan was sent and was pending.  However given this 
finding and persistent fevers of neutropenia voriconazole was 
added back to abx regimen.  

6. Hypotension: The patient was on and off pressors throughout 
the hospitalization.  Echo initially showed decreased EF, which 
gradually became hyperdynamic as she continued to be septic.  
She was on levo, then vasopressin, and is currently off 
pressors.  She did not require any further pressors.  Even with 
her bacteremia her BP remained in the 100's.  She was given 
fluid boluses as needed and PRBCs.  Her volume status corrected 
on its own as the patient autodiuresed which helped to 
substantially decrease her peripheral edema. 

7. Right dilated pupil- First noted around the time of 
admission.  There was concern for CVA so MRI was done which was 
negative for stroke.  At that point it was felt the dilated may 
have been secondary to infiltration due to AML.  However given 
her other medical conditions this was not further worked up 
until later in her course.   As she improved form a resp 
standpoint, her right eye was re-addressed.  Along with mental 
status changes there was concern for stroke.  Once again MRI of 
head was done.  This time there was evidence of ischemia in 2 
areas of the brain.   One was a watershed area which may have 
occurred when the patient was hypotensive.  The other was a 
small stroke that was concerning for embolic event.  However 
neither stroke could account for her MS changes or the dilated 
right pupil.  Ophtho was consulted and it was discovered that 
the patient had acute angle glaucoma in the right eye which 
could account for the dilation.  She was started on drops and 
her IOP slowly decreased.  It was felt she likely had acute 
glaucoma around time of admission leading to the dilatation of 
the right eye. 

8. Neuro- As we were weaning the patint off the sedatives she 
was very slow to respond and given the dilated right pupil there 
was concerns about stroke and malignanat involvement of the CNS. 
 As described above she had MRI which showed evidence of two 
areas of ischemia in the brain.  However they were small and 
could not account for her MS changes.  Lumbar puncture was done 
to rule out malignant involvement.  This came  back negative for 
malignant cells in the CSF.  Her stroke risk was also worked up 
with negative vascular disease, carotid stenosis, and negaitve 
echo.  Her MS slowly improved with time and was felt to have 
been caused by slow metabolism of the on board sedatives.  She 
gradually woke up and retured to relatively baseline MS.  
Unfortunately she had developed severe muscle weakness during 
her stay likely secondary to steroids and critical illness.  EMG 
and nerve conduction studies showed severe ICU myopathy and 
polyneuropathy.  Her strength very slowly improved and PT saw 
the patient and gave the family exercises to work on with the 
patient.

     RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND.  No prior studies.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The liver is enlarged and echogenic in appearance. There appears to be an ill-
     defined hypoechoic 2cm nodule within the right lobe of the liver. The
     gallbladder contains a small 6- mm polyp vs. adherent stone. There is no
     gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The common bile duct measures
     2 mm. There is no intrahepatic ductal dilation. Limited views of the right
     kidney are unremarkable.  No free fluid is seen in the right upper quadrant.
     There appears to be increased flow within the IVC. Normal hepatopetal flow is
     seen within the main portal vein.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No evidence of cholangitis.  Heptomegaly and increased echogenicity of the
     liver.  Increased echogenicity suggests fatty liver.  More advanced forms of
     hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study. Possible
     right hepatic lobe nodule. MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

     tube and NG tube are unchanged in position.  There is no pneumothorax.  Stable
     cardiomegaly.   There has been interval worsening of bilateral predominantly
     perihilar alveolar opacities.  In addition, multiple prominent septal lines
     are visualized.  These findings are more consistent with evolving pulmonary
     edema rather than diffuse pneumonia, however, underlying pneumonia cannot be
     excluded.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Worsening, predominantly perihilar opacification, likely
     consistent with pulmonary edema.  Underlying pneumonia is difficult to

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  AML and mental status changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar pre and post contrast T1-weighted images including
     thin section images through the orbits with fat saturation were obtained.
     Coronal STIR images and axial T2-weighted, susceptibility, FLAIR and
     diffusion-weighted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The globes, orbital fat, optic nerves and extraocular muscles appear normal.
     The superior ophthalmic veins are somewhat prominent bilaterally.  There is
     normal enhancement of the cavernous sinuses.  Meckel's caves appear normal.
     The optic chiasm is normal.  The suprasellar cistern is well maintained.
     
     No meningeal enhancement is seen.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in
     size.  There is no evidence of a recent infarct on the diffusion-weighted
     images.
     
     As expected given the diagnosis of AML, the diploic space shows less fatty
     marrow than normal for this aged patient.  There is soft tissue thickening in
     the paranasal sinuses.  There are small air-fluid levels in several ethmoid
     air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  The brain appears normal without evidence of a recent infarct or
     leptomeningeal enhancement.
     2.  The orbits are also normal.
     3.  There is soft tissue thickening in multiple paranasal sinuses with small
     air-fluid levels noted in the ethmoid air cells.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: AML, respiratory distress.
     
     There are no prior CT studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed following
     administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There is a left sided subclavian central venous catheter,
     endotracheal tube and NG tube present in stable position compared to the prior
     chest x-ray.  The bronchi are patent to the segmental level bilaterally. There
     is dense bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation with associated
     pleural effusions.  Dependent compressive atelectasis is also seen.  The
     remainder of the lung demonstrates several areas of nonspecific peripherally
     located patchy opacities with a more confluent wedge shaped opacity seen in
     the periphery of the right lung.  There are several prominent mediastinal
     lymph nodes with the largest prevascular node measuring approximately 1.0 cm
     in short axis.  There are no other areas of adenopathy identified.
     
     The visualized portions of the upper abdomen are remarkable for patchy and
     wedge shaped areas of hypodensity in the spleen most consistent with splenic
     infarct.  There is also an unusual nodular and atrophic appearance to segment
     4 of the liver.  The visualized portions of the liver are otherwise
     unremarkable.  The visualized upper abdominal vasculature including the
     splenic vein, portal vein, hepatic vein appear patent.  There is ascites
     demonstrated in the upper abdomen.  A small calcification consistent with a
     stone is identified in the gallbladder.  Limited visualization of the pancreas
     demonstrates scattered punctate calcifications, atrophy and dilated pancreatic
     ducts suggestive of chronic pancreatitis.  Note is also made of anasarca in
     the visualized subuctaneous tissues with unusual asymmetric edematous changes
     in the right upper extremity.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Dense lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation with associated effusions.
     
     2) Findings consistent with splenic infarcts.
     
     3) Nonspecific patchy peripheral and more wedge shaped areas of opacity in the
                                                                 (Over)

     mid and upper lungs.  Especially given the findings in the spleen, the
     possibility of infarcts are raised.  Note is made that the pulmonary arteries
     appear grossly unremarkable, without filling defects although this study was
     not timed as a pulmonary angiogram.
     
     4) Atrophic nodular appearance to segment four of the liver.  Findings also
     suggestive of chronic pancreatitis.  Given these findings and the associated
     findings in the spleen dedicated imaging of the abdomen is suggested following
     clearance of the current contrast bolus.
     
     These results were discussed with the referring house staff following
     interpretation of the study.

     INDICATION:  History of AML and recent decline clinically.  Evaluate for
     interval changes in chest.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     AP single view obtained with the patient in semierect position is analyzed and
     direct comparison with a previous similar study dated [**2696-12-29**].  The
     patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position.  The same holds for
     the NG tube and left subclavian approach central venous line.  The previously
     described extensive bilateral confluenting parenchymal infiltrates remain and
     may even have progressed, in particular on the left side where spontaneous air
     bronchograms can be identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Location of mostly central bilateral pulmonary densities were suggestive of
     pulmonary edema.  Over the multiple portable chest examinations obtained
     during the last week, more patchy albeit confluenting densities have developed
     so that the possibility of superimposed infectious processes must be
     considered.

     INDICATION:  A 53-year-old woman with AML,pulmonary disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
     
     The comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated [**2697-1-4**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The endotracheal tube, right IJ line, and nasogastric tube are unchanged
     compared to the prior study.
     
     Again note is made of bilateral patchy parenchymal opacities, somewhat more
     confluent in bilateral lower lobes, associated with effusion, gradually
     worsening compared to the prior study.  No evidence of pneumothorax is noted.
     The cardiac contours and mediastinal contours are obscured.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Gradual worsening of bilateral patchy parenchymal opacities associated with
     effusion, and the patient is status post intubation and AML.  These findings
     are most likely representing combination of edema due to severe ARDS, and
     extensive pneumonia.  Radiographically, diffuse hemorrhage and leukemic
     infiltration are in differential.

     Evaluate lungs for increasing abnormalities.
     
     FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  Configuration favors the
     left ventricle, a finding which in conjunction with mildly widened thoracic
     aorta is compatible with systemic hypertension.  There is, however, no
     pulmonary vascular congestion and no evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates
     can be found.  The pleural spaces are free, both laterally and posteriorly.
     Mildly accentuated kyphosis noted in the thoracic spine without evidence of
     locally compressed vertebral body.  Otherwise, the bony structures of the
     thorax are unremarkable.
     
     There exists no previous chest exams in our records available for comparison.

     INDICATION:  Patient with AML and recent chronic clinical status.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2697-1-8**].
     
     REPORT:  An ET tube is identified in situ with its tip 3.5 cm above the
     carina.  Right-sided internal jugular line is identified terminating at the
     atriocaval junction.
     
     There is diffuse air space consolidation identified throughout all segments of
     both lungs.  Comparison to radiograph done back over the last week shows
     significant deterioration.  There are probably small effusions identified
     bilaterally.  The appearances favor a diagnosis of ARDS, although other
     disease such as congestive change, pneumonia, or leukemic infiltrates cannot
     be ruled out.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     Again demonstrated is extensive air space consolidation, unchanged from
     previous day's examination, which represents a marked deterioration over the
     last week, most consistent with ARDS.  Tracheostomy tube and ET tube in good
     position.

     INDICATION:  Decreased mentation with right blown pupil.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Head CT without contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Study is somewhat limited due to the motion artifact.
     
     An area of low attenuation is visualized in the left occipital lobe.  A small
     area of low attenuation is also visualized in the left parietal lobe.  There
     is no mass effect, hydrocephalous, or shift of normally midline structures.
     The visualized pattern of the sinus is normal.  Osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Area of low attenuation in the left occipitoparietal lobe is consistent with
     an infarction of uncertain age. Please correlate clinically.`
     
     Please note that an MRI is more sensitive in the evaluation of acute stroke.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images of the brain according to
     standard departmental protocol.  No prior study for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is an area of restricted diffusion within the left
     occipitoparietal lobes which appears slightly bright on T2 weighted images.
     There are few foci and confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity within the
     periventricular and deep white matter cerebral hemispheres.  There are air
     fluid levels within both sphenoid sinus air cells, and minimal mucosal
     thickening involving the right maxillary sinus.  Additionally bilateral
     mastoid air cells are hyperintense on T2 weighted images.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Acute to subacute infarct involving the left occipital and
     parietal lobe.
     
     Minimal chronic small vessel ischemic infarcts.
     
     ? of acute sinusitis involving the sphenoid sinuses with minimal mucosal
     thickening involving the right maxillary sinus.  This finding may be of

     INDICATION:  A 53-year-old woman with AML, ARDS, hemoptysis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
     
     The comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated [**2697-1-26**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube, right IJ line remained in place.  Heart is
     mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Again, note is made
     of bilateral pleural effusion, and patchy parenchymal opacities in both lungs
     associated with increased interstitial markings, overall unchanged compared to
     the prior study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Persistent bilateral patchy parenchymal opacities with increased interstitial
     markings and pleural effusion, representing ARDS.

     INDICATION:  Respiratory distress, ARDS.  Mechanical ventilation with
     worsening lung compliance, pleural effusions, AML.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT chest [**2696-12-25**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the lungs without
     administration of IV contrast.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There has been interval placement of a
     tracheostomy, which is in appropriate position.  The trachea is slightly bowed
     outwards at the balloon. There is a left-sided PICC seen within the left
     subclavian vein and terminating within the mid-SVC.  There are moderate sized,
     bilateral pleural effusions which appear slightly increased when compared to
     previous study.  There is again reactive collapse/atelectasis dependently.
     There has been interval development of significant diffuse, bilateral
     increased interstitial and alveolar opacities. There are also more focal areas
     of superimposed consolidation. These findings are nonspecific and may
     represent infection vs. hypersensitivity pneumonitis. There are non-
     pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes. There is no pneumothorax.
     
     Limited views of the upper abdomen show hypoattenuating areas within the
     spleen as seen previously.  These hypoattenuating areas contain peripheral,
     rim calcification.  There has been interval placement of a percutaneous
     gastrostomy tube.  There is also a small amount of calcification seen within
     the gallbladder consistent with gallstones.  There is a small of fluid around
     the gallbladder.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, which appear slightly
     increased compared to the previous study.
     2)  Interval development of significant diffuse increased interstitial and
     alveolar opacities with focal consolidations. These findings may be seen in
     superimposed infection or hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
     3)  Slight enlargement of the trachea by the tracheostomy balloon. 4)
     Multiple wedge shaped hypoattenuating areas within the spleen as seen
     previously suggestive of infarcts.  In this noncontrast study, rim
     calcification can now be appreciated.

     alkaline phosphatase.
     
     RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:  No prior studies are available for
     comparison.  The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities.  There
     is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The common bile duct
     measures 4 mm in maximal diameter.  The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal
     flow.  Small to moderate volume of ascites is present surrounding the liver
     and within the gallbladder fossa.  There is mild thickening of the gallbladder
     wall with focal area of edema at the fundus.  The gallbladder itself is not
     distended, and these findings likely represent third spacing.  There is a
     focal area of thickening at the gallbladder fundus with an echogenic focus
     within it, suggesting adenomyomatosis.  The right and left kidneys measure
     12.0 and 12.5 cm, respectively.  Both are echogenic, but no stones, masses, or
     hydronephrosis are present.  Note is made of bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Small volume of ascites.
     
     2)  Mild gallbladder wall thickening and focal edema, without evidence of
     gallbladder distention to suggest acute cholecystitis.  These findings likely
     reflect third spacing.
     
     3)  Findings suggestive of focal adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder.
     
     4)  Bilateral pleural effusions.

     HISTORY:  53 year-old female with ARDS, request PICC line for chemotherapy,
     antibiotics, bedside IV placement failed.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
     
     The procedure was peformed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 930**] [**Name (STitle) 931**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 7514**], attending radiologist, present and supervising the components of the
     procedure.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table, the left upper-arm
     was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  The left brachial vein
     was accessed using ultrasound guidance after local administration of 1%
     Lidocaine with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle.  An 0l8 guidewire was advanced
     through the needle using fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for
     a 4.5 micropuncture sheath with inner dilator after a small skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was made
     with a #11 blade scalpel at the insertion site.  The innner dilator was
     removed.  It was determined that the length of 31 cm would be adequate.  The
     PICC line was trimmed to length, and advanced over the guidewire into the
     superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire, and peelaway
     sheath were removed.  A final fluoroscopic chest x-ray demonstrates the tip of
     the dual-lumen PICC line to be in the superior vena cava.  The line was
     flushed, capped, and heplocked, and secured to the skin using statlock.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Successful placement of 31 cm left brachial dual-lumen PICC line with tip in
     the superior vena cava, O.K. for use.

Neuro: At 2000 pt was noted to be breathing 5-10 breaths over vent setting of 37. Increased Fentanyl to 250mcg/hr and Versed to 25mg/hr. Pt has been non responsive all night. Did not wake pt due to hemodynamic and resp. instability.

Resp: Vent settings at this time are: PCV 40 PEEP 8, FIO2 80%. Tidal volumes have been 290's to 345. Lungs are clear throughout with good air movement. RR now in sync with vent at 40 BPM. Sats have been 98-100%. ABG at 2300 7.18/59/72. After peep lowered to 5 ABG showed 7.14/65/86. No new orders. Will repeat ABG at 0600 per Intern. Pt is afebrile, though yesterday AM pt was running a low grade temp so blood cx x2 sent from A-Line and Fem Line. 

C/V: At 1900 levophed was infusing at 0.213. At aprox. 2100 MAPs began to drop. Increased levophed to 0.30 without effect. MAPs dropping into mid 40's to low 50's. At 2120 dopamine hung at 25 mcg/kg/min. Have decreased pressors for short times but then needed to increase once again when MAPs drop into upper 50's and don't rebound. Goal is to keep MAPs 65 or better. Also given A 500ml bolus of NSS at 2100 without effect and again at 2315. These boluses did not have any effect on BP but at 0500 urine output increased. HR was in 80's while pt was hypotensive despite increased pressors. Later went as high as 130's where it is at this time. Appears to be sinus tach.

GU/GI: Foley patent, draining amber colored urine with sediment. Abd is soft, distended. No bowel sounds. Tube feeds on hold at this time. 

Endo: Blood sugar's obtained Q2h ranging 64 to 90. AT 0400 BS 57, given 1 amp D50. 

Plan: Pt is DNR status. Monitor lytes and repleat as necessary. Titrate pressors to keep MAP's 65 or better. Titrate sedation to keep pt from breathing over vent. Monitor blood sugars and treat as per ss.  Obtain ABG's for any vent changes. Provide support to family as pt declines toward CMO status.  Call family if needed to come in.

UO improved after fld boluses.

Hypothermic to 94.3PO. Room warmed. Blanket placed over pt. No antibiotic changes. Cont on contact, droplet & neutrapenic precautions.

Remains NPO . Mod residuals from PEG. No BS Abd, soft. No stool

Family notified when pt becoming hypotentive. They are waare of gravity of the situation & the fact pt is acidotic on max vent settings.

D50 X1 for hypoglycemia

Pt appears very comfortable on fent & versed gtts.

A/P; Acidotic on max vent support. 
 vasopressin may be increaed to 0.12 max if pt becomes more hypotensive.

Neuro: Pt kept hevily sedated with Fentanyl 250mcg/hr and Versed 18mg/hr to avoid overbreathing the vent.

Resp: Vent set at PCV 40 peep 8 100% FIO2. Sats have been dropping through the night and are now 84%. Intern informed and he went to talk with the family. The husband wants to discuss options with the rest of the family but states they are not all here yet. Attempted to sx without results. Pt is afebrile. 

C/V: MAP maintained with Dopamine 20mcg/kg/min, Levophed .3mg/hr and Vasopressin .04 u/min. Attempted to decreasd pressors as MAPs have been in the 80's but MAPs dropped into the 50's. Fingers and toes becoming dusky and cold to touch. Family has many questions about pressors and I attempted to answer them . I believe family is begining to think about the CMO approach. 

GU/GI: Foley cath patent and is draining clear yellow urine. Abd is soft/distended. Kept NPO as there have been very high residuals suggesting any infusion via GT is just sitting in the stomach. There has been no stool. 

Social: Husband, sister and daughter have been here all night, taking turns coming in to check on her. Asking appropriate questions. They want to discuss options with the rest of the family before they will make any decisions. 

Plan: Provide emotional support to family.
