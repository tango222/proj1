Admission Date:  [**2566-4-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2566-4-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2487-5-17**]     Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year-old man who
developed slurred speech and left arm weakness on [**2566-4-11**].
He was transferred from [**Hospital 770**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 374**] Emergency Department.  He had no
history of trauma, reportedly had some emesis a few times
prior to going to the Emergency Room.  The patient also
developed a severe rash over his left side of his face and
also with left sided eye pain over the last one to two days
prior to admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown at the time of admission
except for back pain and incontinence.

MEDICATIONS:  Detrol and Vicodin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs blood pressure 184/85.
HEENT normocephalic with very impressive vesicular rash
extending along the left side of the forehead to the
periorbital region down to the tip of the nose and back
toward the ears of the left side.  No involvement of the
tympanic membranes or external auditory canal.  There was
very sharp demarcation at the midline of the forehead.  His
left eye had periorbital edema and is closed.  When open the
sclera was injected.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  On
fluorescent examination there was a very small lesion less
then 2 mm in length in the center of the portion of the
cornea.  This also may also represent a dendritic ulcer,
however, corneal abrasion could not be completely ruled out.
The patient states he is able to see throughout the eye,
however, visual acuity examination is unattainable.
Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.
There is a left sided facial droop noted.  The patient is
unable to bluff his left cheek.  Tongue was midline, although
widely patent.  Neck was supple, nontender.  No
lymphadenopathy.  No jugular vein distention.  Cardiovascular
regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Chest
clear to auscultation.  Breath sounds are equal bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.  As noted no rebound or
guarding.  Extremities the patient moves all of the
extremities appropriately.  Strength was 5 out of 5 and equal
bilaterally.  Sensation was intact as well as excellent
strength.  Reflexes were appropriate.  The patient had left
sided facial droop as noted.  Neurological examination
comprehension was intact, repetition was intact, dysarthria
was present.  Eyes closed, follows commands, attempts to
follow eye to voice, oriented to name to [**Location (un) 695**], thinks the
year was 1974.  Examination at [**Hospital1 73**] Emergency Room he was unable to lift his left arm off
the bed.  His IPs were 4 out of 5.  His right face was
without a droop and he again had 5 out of 5 strength.

LABORATORY:  His white blood cell count was 13.1.  His
hematocrit was 33.9, platelets 219, sodium 140, potassium
4.4, chloride 100, BUN 19, creatinine 1.1, blood sugar 168.
Head CT showed a right frontal bleed on two different
densities, possibly areas more acute then the other, but a
bleed within the last day.  No midline shift noted.  The
approximate size of the frontal bleed was 3 by 3 by 3.5 cm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit to keep his blood pressure less then 140, keep his
INR less then 1.4 and his platelets greater then 100,000.  An
ophthalmology consult was done for possible herpes zoster.
He was kept fluid restricted and CT scan was going to be
repeated on the morning of the 17th.  Ophthalmology did see
the patient on the 16th at 6:00 p.m.  They felt that he had
herpes zoster of his left eye area.  No corneal involvement.
He also had conjunctivitis and mild preseptal cellulitis.  He
was started on bacitracin and/or Erythromycin q.i.d. to his
left eye.  On the [**4-12**] the patient was arousable and
oriented times one, continued with his left sided weakness
and left facial weakness.  He was started as per
ophthalmology on Bacitracin ointment and he was monitored
closely.  CT on the 17th was stable with hematoma no changes.
On the [**4-13**] the patient's family was spoken to. His
son stated that his father requested a DNR/DNI and it was
explained the patient's condition at that time.  His son
stated that dad and he had discussed this and would not want
it to go any further.  A DNR was signed again on the 18th.

On the [**4-14**] the patient continued to be monitored in
the Intensive Care Unit setting.  He had an nasogastric tube
placed and tube feedings were started.  Also he was started
on Lopresor and Hydralazine for his blood pressure control
and Acyclovir for his herpes zoster.  His medications at this
time included a nitro drip, Dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis, Erythromycin ointment for his herpes zoster,
Hydralazine for his blood pressure, Kefzol, Acyclovir,
Pepcid, Lopressor and Tylenol.  Ophthalmology also followed
up on the 19th and continued to state it was herpes zoster
infection.  No corneal involvement, positive conjunctivitis
and to continue ointment in both eyes.  Acyclovir switched to
po.  On the 19th also case management has become involved
with the patient in hopes of transferring him to a facility.
On the 20th the patient became more obtunded.  A CAT scan was
unchanged and it remained unclear why the patient became more
obtunded.  An LP was done and the patient was pan cultured.
Also on the 20th an A line was placed and a subclavian line
was placed due to insufficient peripheral access.  Urology
was called to place a Foley due to a history of prostate CA.
The patient had pulled out his Foley.  The new Foley was
placed without difficulty.  On the 21st it was felt that the
patient was more awake.  On the [**4-16**] physical therapy
was consulted and he was followed for assessing a
strengthening mobility, however, he was found not to be alert
enough to work with them at this time.

On the [**4-16**] an infectious disease consult was
completed.  At that time urine showed occasional bacteria, no
yeast, 3 to 5 red blood cells.  Cerebral spinal fluid showed
in tube four 115 white blood cells, 213 red blood cells, tube
one showed 75 white blood cells, 565 red blood cells, glucose
82.  There was a question of possible growth of varicella PCR
in the cerebral spinal fluid.  Infectious disease recommended
increasing Acyclovir to 1000 mg q week for best coverage of
the VCV, to add VCV PCR cerebral spinal fluid to confirm the
diagnosis, to consider MRI/MRA of cerebral angio as VCV
vasculitis can have this characteristic of the appearance on
angio.  Also Levofloxacin 500 mg q 24 and Flagyl 500 mg
intravenous q 8 were added for what was thought to be an
aspiration pneumonia.  Ophthalmology also came back on the
21st and agreed with the infectious disease recommendation.
He does not appear to have preseptal cellulitis.  The patient
was started on Ilotycin OD t.i.d. and Lacrilube OD and
Ilotycin OS t.i.d.  On the 22nd an MRI and MRA of the head
was ordered along with aggressive chest physical therapy and
suctioning.  It was felt that the patient was improving
neurologically.  On the 21st again it showed that VCV/PCR was
pending on the cerebral spinal fluid. The patient continued
on Levo and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia and his Kefzol
was stopped for what was thought to be periorbital
cellulitis.

On the 23rd the patient was awake and moving his right toes,
squeezing his right hand, oriented times person.  On the [**4-19**] the patient was afebrile, turned his head and he would
open his eyes and follow single commands, he was moving the
right side spontaneously.  Infectious disease felt that the
patient most likely had zoster encephalitis and he was
getting somewhat worse from a pulmonary standpoint.  Repeated
aspiration, given poor mental status.  Chest x-ray was also
worse on the 24th.  He was continued on Acyclovir, Levo and
Flagyl.  On the [**4-20**] the family made the patient
comfort measures only and the patient passed away comfortably
on [**2566-4-21**] at 7:58 a.m.  His family was notified at that
time.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 78-year-old male with possible aspiration.
     
     Comparison is made to a prior exam earlier of the same day at 10:36 hours.
     
     FINDINGS: A left subclavian central venous line and NG tube are seen in stable
     position. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal borders are unchanged. The
     pulmonary vasculature is normal. The possibility of a small left effusion
     remains. However, there is some improved aeration of the left base. Note is
     made of right AC joint degenerative change.
     
     IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of left basilar opacity, although minimal
     opacity remains. Atelectasis and/or aspiration/consolidation are possible.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Assess for vasculitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted brain imaging was obtained
     including the use of diffusion weighted scans.  Essentially, this study is of
     extremely marginal technical quality due to gross patient motion.
     
     The known large right frontal-parietal hemorrhage is redemonstrated, though
     less clearly on the CT scan of [**4-14**].  No gross change in this lesion is
     apparent, allowing for extreme degrees of patient motion.  The diffusion
     weighted images show that the hemorrhage has largely high rates of diffusion,
     as evidenced by marked hypointensity within it.
     
     MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
     
     TECHNIQUE: Three dimensional time of flight imaging with multiplanar
     reconstructions.
     
     FINDINGS: Once again, the study is moderately degraded by patient motion.
     
     There is a prominent degree of stenosis of the supraclinoid portion of the
     right internal carotid artery.  I cannot clearly identify the distal left
     vertebral artery, which may well be quite hypoplastic, as faintly delineated
     on a few source images.  The other major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 309**]
     are patent. Once again, assessment for small aneurysms or more subtle evidence
     of vasculitis is thwarted by extreme degrees of patient motion.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Clinical suspicion for aspiration.
     
     Comparison is made to previous chest x-ray of three days earlier.
     
     A vascular catheter and feeding tube remain in place.  The heart is mildly
     enlarged, and there is pulmonary vascular engorgement, as well as perihilar
     haziness.  Additionally, there is a new area of air space opacification within
     the left lung, predominantly in the perihilar region, and extending into the
     left retrocardiac area.  There remains mild elevation of the left
     hemidiaphragm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Asymmetric air space opacification in the left perihilar region.
     Considering clinical suspicion for aspiration, this may be due to an
     aspiration event.  Differential diagnosis includes asymmetric pulmonary edema.
     
     2. Congestive heart failure with vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness and
     peribronchial cuffing.

remains DNR/DNI--contact precautions

neuro: seemed more alert and responsive immediately upon return from MRI last evening, was trying to respond verbally to son; after this visit pt seemed to return to lethargic state, then toward early morning became restless and morphine only partially effective for this

CV:  occasional dips into HR 50's but generally stable with NSR and rare to occasional PAC's--BP has remained stable off nipride all night

resp: initially wheezy upon return from MRI, relieved by nebulizers; progressively more rhonchorous throughout the night--vigorously resists attempts to oroparyngeally suction with yankeur--has maintained good SP02 while he wears his 02 (80% neb) but desats to high 80's when he removes it--good ABG this AM

GI: tf tolerated well at 20 cc/hr, minimal residual--no stool

GU: marginal output of dark clear urine

skin: left facial rash continues, moist but not actively draining; right eye with copious purulent drainage, and again pt vigorously resists efforts to clean it and apply ointment

plan/dispo: continue efforts to maintain pulmonary hygiene; balance this against comfort considerations; advance TF as tolerated
