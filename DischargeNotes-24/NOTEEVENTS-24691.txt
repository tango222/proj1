CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for cvl placement 

PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH: 

FINDINGS:

Lung volumes are reduced. Allowing for this and technique, 
cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There 
is a right-sided IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the 
mid SVC. The patient is intubated with ET tube terminating above 
the level of the clavicles. An NG tube terminates within the 
stomach. No pneumothorax is seen on this supine radiograph. 
There is a small amount of atelectasis in the retrocardiac 
region.

IMPRESSION:

Reduced lung volumes with left retrocardiac atelectasis. Central 
venous catheter with its tip in the mid SVC

[**3310-7-16**]

LEFT HEEL, 2 VIEWS:

The ulcer over the heel is noted. Some irregularity of the 
underlying portion of the calcaneus is within the range of 
normal. No focal bone destruction or periosteal new bone 
formation to confirm the presence of osteomyelitis is 
identified. No reactive sclerosis is detected. No fracture is 
identified. Vascular calcification and surgical clips noted.

IMPRESSION: Ulceration. No osteomyelitis identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted [**3310-7-15**] for ischemic foot.

Pt pre-op'd cleared for surgery. IV Antibiotics started. Cx 
taken.

Podiatry consulted / plastics / renal consulted.

Pt recieved PD M/W/F.

Pt underwent a Left common femoral artery to dorsalis pedis 
artery bypass graft in situ using greater saphenous vein, 
angioscopy and valve lysis, revision of distal anastomosis, and 
intraoperative arteriogram.

Pt tolerated th procedure well. There were no complications. Pt 
acidotic transfered to the SICU in stable condition. Intubated.

It was thought that the pt was in metabolic acidosis secondary 
to untreated renal failure, likely secondary to non compliance 
PD.

[**3310-7-17**] - [**3310-7-20**]

Pt extubated.

Podiatry to debride wound. 

Pt remained in SICU. 

[**3310-7-21**]

Pt underwent a debridement of left heel.

Pt tolerated th procedure well. There were no complications. Pt 
extubted in the OR. Transfered to the PACU in stable condition.

Once reccoperated from anesthesia pt transfered to the VICU in 
stable condition.

Pt had VAC after the procedure.

Pt recieved PRBC's

     COMPARISON:  [**3310-7-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable semiupright chest.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the right internal jugular
     venous access catheter, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube.  Interval
     placement of left-sided PICC with tip terminating in the distal SVC, just
     above the SVC/RA junction.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are
     unchanged.  In comparison with the previous examination, there is resolution
     of congestive heart failure and improved aeration, with minimal residual
     atelectasis at the left base and in the right perihilar region.  The osseous
     structures are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Left PICC tip in distal SVC, just above the SVC/RA junction.  This was
     discussed with [**Doctor First Name 5101**] of IV therapy at approximately 11:00 a.m.
     2.  Resolution of congestive heart failure.
     3  Mild right perihilar and left basilar atelectasis.

     evaluation.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to AP chest radiograph from [**3310-7-29**].
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were reviewed.  The
     radiograph was not obtained at peak expiratory effort.  Therefore, there are
     low lung volumes.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
     are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
     pneumothoraces.  No focal areas of consolidation are identified.  The
     visualized osseous structures are grossly normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, otherwise normal radiographic appearance of the
     chest.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.

     HISTORY:  Left heel ulcer and gangrene of the left hand.
     
     FINDINGS:  Systolic pressure measurements in the left arm are 216 at the
     brachial level, 207 at the radial level, 199 at the ulnar level, and 36 at the
     digit level.  Waveforms of the brachial level were triphasic, those distally
     were monophasic, waveforms at the digit level were difficult to extract.  The
     volume recordings were performed bilaterally.  These remain symmetric
     bilaterally up to the level of the wrist. At the digit level, there was a
     marked relative decline in amplitude on the left when compared to the right.
     
     Doppler evaluation lower extremities demonstrate triphasic waveforms at the
     femoral and popliteal levels on the right, that at the right PT level was
     absent, and at the DP level was monophasic.  All other waveforms on the left
     are monophasic with an absent signal from the left PT level.  ABI measurements
     are inaccurate due to vessel non-compressibility.  Volume recordings are in
     accord with the Doppler tracings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Significant decline in inflow to the left digits, there appears to be
     relatively normal arterial inflow to the level of the left wrist.
     2.  Significant right-sided tibial disease and in particular involving the PT
     artery.
     3.  Left-sided aortoiliac disease and definite left-sided tibial disease as
     indicated by an absent PT waveform.

     HISTORY: 45-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes, severe peripheral
     vascular disease, status post left third finger amputation. Requires PICC for
     long-term IV antibiotics including vancomycin.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2240**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**]
     (the attending radiologist, who was present and supervising).
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The patient's right upper arm was prepped and draped
     in standard sterile fashion. After infusion of 1% lidocaine, the right basilic
     vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle under ultrasonographic guidance. A
     0.018 wire was advanced into the superior vena cava (SVC) under flouroscopic
     guidance. Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a 43-
     cm PICC would be appropriate. The PICC was cut to fit and advanced over a 4-
     French introducer sheath. The wire and sheath were removed. The line was
     flushed and hep locked and secured with a Stat-Lock. Final chest image
     demonstrated appropriate positioning of the PICC tip in the distal SVC. The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there are no immediate post-procedure
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of right, 43cm long, basilic vein PICC with

      45 year old woman with poorly controlled DM I, severe PVD, s/p L 3rd finger 
      amputation/revision. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      place PICC for vancomycin administration                                        
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 45-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes, severe peripheral
     vascular disease, status post left third finger amputation. Requires PICC for
     long-term IV antibiotics including vancomycin.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2240**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**]
     (the attending radiologist, who was present and supervising).
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The patient's right upper arm was prepped and draped
     in standard sterile fashion. After infusion of 1% lidocaine, the right basilic
     vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle under ultrasonographic guidance. A
     0.018 wire was advanced into the superior vena cava (SVC) under flouroscopic
     guidance. Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a 43-
     cm PICC would be appropriate. The PICC was cut to fit and advanced over a 4-
     French introducer sheath. The wire and sheath were removed. The line was
     flushed and hep locked and secured with a Stat-Lock. Final chest image
     demonstrated appropriate positioning of the PICC tip in the distal SVC. The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there are no immediate post-procedure
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of right, 43cm long, basilic vein PICC with
     tip in the distal SVC. Line is ready for use.

      45 year old woman with 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Third finger was amputated and since then become necrotic, 4th finger gangrene
      and necrotic wound.  MRA needed to evaluate the vasculature.  Pt may have
      incomplete arch.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with amputated third finger with necrotic wound.
     Fourth finger gangrene.  MRA needed to evaluate vasculature.
     
     STUDY:  Left hand and wrist MRA.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial, coronal HASTE and 2D time-of-flight images were used to
     prescribe a 3D TRICKS imaging of the hand and wrist as well as a multiphase
     gadolinium enhanced 3D T1-weighted gradient echo MRA.  Multiplanar reformats
     and subtractions were made from these images.  Two gadolinium injections were
     performed.
     
     FINDINGS:
     No ulnar artery is visualized.  There is a diffusely very attenuated radial
     artery that is markedly irregular at the wrist.  The radial artery gives rise
     to a markedly attenuated deep palmar arch.  The deep palmar arch gives rise to
     the first, second, third and fourth common metacarpal arterial branches that
     are all diminutive.  Proper digital arteries are not seen.  Flowing in a
     slightly delayed fashion from the carpal portion of the radial artery is a
     palmar carpal arterial arch, though this is incomplete. There is rapid venous
     drainage of contrast from the hand and fingers, particularly about the third
     and fourth metacarpals and proximal digits at sites of recent surgery and
     inflammation.
     
     There is soft tissue irregularity about the base of the amputated third
     proximal phalanx.  There is fluid within the flexor tendon just proximal to
     the third PIP joint with enhancement about this which could suggest a small
     abscess along the flexor tendon.  No other concerning collections within the
     visualized portions of hands and wrist, though there is extensive soft tissue
     enhancement about the third and fourth metacarpals and proximal phalanges
     consistent with recent surgery.  Infection here cannot be excluded.
     
     Multiplanar reformats were essential in evaluating the arteries.
     
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Markedly abnormal arterial supply to the left wrist and hand with no ulnar
     arterial supply to the hand and diminutive radial artery.  Radial artery
     supplies an attenuated incomplete deep palmar arch that supplies the first

     INDICATION:  Right heel ulcer with questionable abscess.  The patient has a
     stable heel ulcer with dry eschar near area of concern.
     
     FINDINGS:  Scans with a linear transducer were performed overlying the
     patient's right plantar heel and adjacent soft tissue swelling extending
     medially.  There are no well-defined fluid collections identified.  Edematous
     changes are demonstrated in the subcutaneous tissues.  There is also note of
     an unusual 1.1 x 1.1-cm focus, which is approximately 1 cm deep to the skin
     overlying the medial aspect of the right heel, which causes acoustic
     shadowing.  This structure does not appear to elongate as would be expected
     for a vessel.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No definite abscess identified.
     
     2.  Edematous changes in the subcutaneous tissues.
     
     3.  Unusual shadowing focus in the medial aspect of the right heel, which
     could represent calcifications in the subcutaneous tissues.  Given the less
     likely alternative that this represents air, CT is recommended for further
     evaluation.

     HISTORY:  Left common femoral to DP graft, with heel ulcers.
     
     FINDINGS:  Doppler evaluation shows a peak systolic velocity of 177 cm within
     the left common femoral artery and at the proximal graft anastomosis with this
     vessel, 146 cm/sec.  Graft velocities range from a minimum of 80 to a maximum
     of 289 cm/sec, the latter at the distal graft anastomosis.  Within the distal
     native vessel, the peak systolic velocity is 200 cm/sec.
     
     Noninvasive evaluation of the right lower extremity was also performed due to
     heel ulceration.  Triphasic waveforms at the femoral through popliteal levels,
     monophasic waveforms distally.  ABI measurements are inaccurate bilaterally
     due to vessel non-compressibility.  Volume recordings demonstrate amplitude
     loss and waveform widening from the low thigh distally on the right.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     HISTORY:  Left common femoral to DP graft, with heel ulcers.
     
     FINDINGS:  Doppler evaluation shows a peak systolic velocity of 177 cm within
     the left common femoral artery and at the proximal graft anastomosis with this
     vessel, 146 cm/sec.  Graft velocities range from a minimum of 80 to a maximum
     of 289 cm/sec, the latter at the distal graft anastomosis.  Within the distal
     native vessel, the peak systolic velocity is 200 cm/sec.
     
     Noninvasive evaluation of the right lower extremity was also performed due to
     heel ulceration.  Triphasic waveforms at the femoral through popliteal levels,
     monophasic waveforms distally.  ABI measurements are inaccurate bilaterally
     due to vessel non-compressibility.  Volume recordings demonstrate amplitude
     loss and waveform widening from the low thigh distally on the right.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Widely patent left common femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass graft.  PVR at
     the left metatarsal level does not suggest compromised inflow to this level.
     2.  Significant right-sided tibial disease.

     INDICATION:  46-year-old woman with healed ulcer, status post angioplasty.
     
     FINDINGS:  Right leg was examined.  There is triphasic flow pattern at the
     femoral and popliteal arteries.  No tracing was detectable at the posterior
     tibial artery, and monophasic flow pattern was detected at the dorsalis pedis
     artery.  The vessels are noncompressible.  There has been some interval
     improvement in pulse volume recording compared to prior study from [**3311-2-24**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Heel ulcer.  Requires long-term IV antibiotics.  IV team was not
     able to advance the PICC line.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5118**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the attending radiologist was present during the entire procedure
     supervising.
     
     The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for
     localization of a suitable vein.  The right basilic vein was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% lidocaine, the right
     basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge
     needle.  Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous
     access documenting vessel patency. A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced in
     superior vena cava. Based on markers on the guidewire, it was determined that
     a length of 42 cm would be suitable. The PICC line was then trimmed to length
     and advanced over a 4- French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance in
     superior vena cava. The sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A
     final chest x-ray was obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in
     superior vena cava just above the right atrium. The line is ready for use. The
     StatLock device was applied and the line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 39-cm right basilic PICC line with the
     tip in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.
