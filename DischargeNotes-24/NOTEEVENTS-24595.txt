CT head without contrast [**3306-9-6**]: FINDINGS: There is a large 
region of high attenuation within the right frontal lobe and the 
region of the right basal ganglia. This is consistent with 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, more likely hypertensive in 
etiology. No significant subarachnoid or intraventricular 
hemorrhage is appreciated. There is mass effect present with 
shift of the normally midline structures towards the left. There 
is also left sided subfalcine herniation. There is no 
hydrocephalus. The visualized osseous structures and paranasal 
sinuses are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe. This most likely 
relates to hypertensive hemorrhage, as opposed to a ruptured 
right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 75 year old right handed male with past medical 
history of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, 
hyperlipidemia, dementia with sudden onset left sided weakness, 
dysarthria. Head CT demonstrated a large right intracerebral 
hemorrhage, centered around basal ganglia and putamen. We felt 
this was likely secondary to hypertension. While still in the 
emergency department, he had rapid decompensation necessitating 
intubation for airway protection. Examination post intubation 
but off intubations showed clinical evidence of elevated 
intracranial pressure and brainstem compression. The overall 
prognosis was guarded. He was admitted to the 
Neurology/Neurosurgery ICU.

He was loaded with Mannitol and Dilantin in the emergency room. 
He was evaluated by the Neurosurgery service and they did not 
feel a surgical intervention or ventriculary drain was 
warranted.  After arrival in the ICU, patient was followed with 
neuro checks every 1 hour. Sedation was held to allow for 
frequent exams. Head of bed was kept at 30 degrees. Labetalol 
continuous infusion was titrated for systolic blood pressure of 
130-160. Mannitol and Dilantin were continued. After lengthy 
discussion, the patient's wife opted to make him DNR on 
afternoon of [**3306-9-6**].

Overnight, fresh frozen plasma was given for goal INR of <1.4. 
On serial exams by neurology and ICU attendings in the morning 
on [**3306-9-7**], patient had no clinical signs of brainstem 
activity. Namely, he was unresponsive. Pupils were fixed and 
dilated. No corneal, gag, oculocephalic, and oculovestibular 
reflexes were elicited. He was not overbreathing his ventilator. 
At this point, patient was felt to have clinical signs 
consistent with brain death. Plans were made to proceed with 
apnea testing. However, after discussion with patient's wife, 
this was postponed with test planned on [**3306-9-8**]. Full medical 
care and managment continued overnight [**Date range (1) 5679**].

At approximately 06:00 on [**3306-9-8**], the patient became 
bradycardic. He lapsed first into a junctional rhythm and then 
had very infrequent ventricular escape beats on telemetry. 
Finally, he went asystolic. He was not resuscitated as per 
previous conversations with his wife. He was pronounced dead at 
06:59 am. The patient's wife was notified. The attending was 
notified as well.

Plan:  Support and comfort to wife.
       Apnea test in am, ABG between 6 am-7am.
       Monitor overnight
       DNR status continues with no pressors, no compressions, no cardioversion.
       SErum osms and sodium 1 hour before mannitol doses.

Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2756**] on rounds at bedside at 0635 and just after this patient started to become increasingly hypotensive with bp rapidly dropping to 50-60 systolic.  Another fluid bolus was started with no effect. Calcium gluconate 1 gram iv started. Patient continued to become hypotensive and bradycardic and eventually expired at 0700.
