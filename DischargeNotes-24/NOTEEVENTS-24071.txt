     LIMITED COLOR DOPPLER STUDY OF THE LIVER.
     
     INDICATION:  41 year old woman with liver failure secondary to primary
     sclerosing cholangitis and with abdominal distention.  The question is to rule
     out portal vein thrombosis and to see the amount of ascites.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison was done with a complete previous ultrasound Doppler
     of the abdomen from [**3090-6-27**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver has cirrhotic fissures with a large caudate lobe and
     atrophic right lobe.
     
     There is dilatation of the bile ducts inside the right lobe of the liver.  No
     dilatation is observed in the caudate lobe or outside the liver.  The portal
     vein is wide open with flow in the hepatofugal direction.
     
     There are large dilated and tortuous hepatic arteries.
     
     There is a moderate quantity of ascites inside the pelvis.  An appropriate
     spot was marked for paracentesis to be performed by the Primary Service.
     
     No change is seen in the pattern of flow in the portal vein in comparison to
     the previous examination from [**3090-6-27**].
     
     There is now a larger amount of free ascitic fluid inside the pelvis in
     comparison with the previous examination.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) The portal vein is patent with a hepatofugal pattern of flow.
     
     2) Signs of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
     
     3) Dilated bile ducts in the right lobe of the liver.
     
     4) An appropriate spot was marked for paracentesis to be performed by the
     Primary Service.

     INDICATION: 41 year old with history of primary sclerosing cholangitis with
     left upper quadrant pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast.
     
     CONTRAST: Oral contrast and 150 cc Optiray IV per patient request.
     
     FINDINGS
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.
     
     There is marked atrophy of the right lobe of the liver with bile duct
     dilatation. Dilated ducts are also identified in the left lobe of the liver.
     No definite filling defects are seen. There may be a small central filling
     defect in the right portal vein consistent with a small thrombus. No focal
     liver lesions are identified. The splenic vein is patent. The superior
     mesenteric vein is patent. The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     There is no hydronephrosis and no renal lesions are seen. There are multiple
     splenorenal and gastric varices. The spleen is enlarged. There is no evidence
     of splenic infarct. There is a large amount of ascites. There is a
     recannalized para-umbilical vein. Opacified loops of large and small bowel are
     normal in contour and caliber.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is ascites. The sigmoid and rectum are
     unremarkable. The bladder and distal ureters are normal.
     
     No lytic or blastic bone lesions are seen.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1. There is no evidence of splenic infarct. There is large amount of ascites.
     There are multiple varices about the spleen. If paracentesis is about to be
     performed, ultrasound guidance is suggested.
     2. Findings in the liver are consistent with patient's known diagnosis of

     INDICATION:  Liver failure secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis with
     low grade fevers, evaluate for ascites.
     
     FINDINGS:  A limited abdominal sonogram was performed.  There is a small
     amount of ascites present most pronounced within the pelvis.  There is
     extensive varices throughout the abdomen most pronounced in the region of the
     spleen consistent with known cirrhotic liver disease.  There are multiple
     loops of dilated bowel.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There is a very small amount of ascites present within the

Admission Date:  [**3090-7-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**3090-8-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**3049-2-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:Liver Transplant Service
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
End stage liver disease secondary to primary sclerosing
cholangitis and/or autoimmune hepatitis requiring orthotopic
transplant during this admission.

dictated summary of [**Hospital 874**] hospital course covering period
[**3090-7-18**] to [**3090-7-28**] for history of present illness, past
medical history, family history, social history, medications
on admission, initial physical examination and early hospital
course.

HOSPITAL COURSE FROM [**3090-7-28**] THROUGH [**3090-8-15**]:  The patient
[**3090-7-28**] (hospital day number eleven).  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  Notable
events while in the Intensive Care Unit from [**3090-7-28**] through
[**3090-8-1**] include acute renal failure attributed to acute
tubular necrosis manifested by gradually worsening
creatinine, peaking at 3.6 on [**3090-7-31**] and then improving to
baseline of 1.0 by the day of discharge.  In the Intensive
Care Unit, the patient was also started on total parenteral
nutrition.  On discharge from the Intensive Care Unit on
postoperative day number five the patient was alert and
oriented, tolerating ice chips and sips with medications.
She was noted to be anxious and emotionally labile at times.
By system, following the notable events during the rest of
her hospital stay.

1.  Hepatic/transplant:  The patient was started on an
immunosuppression regimen of CellCept, Cyclosporin and
Prednisone in the postoperative period and she was also on
Rapamycin briefly.  The patient's liver function tests were
noted to trend downward steadily.  Optimal Cyclosporin dosing
was still to be determined on the day of discharge, but it
was expected with continue to monitoring Cyclosporin levels
following discharge.  This should be completed soon.  The
patient is to be discharged on Cyclosporin dose of 175 mg
b.i.d.  The patient's incision was monitored for infection in
collaboration with the Infectious Disease Service during the
immediate postop period.  It went from purulent drainage as
noted from the unction point of her [**Last Name (un) 4526**] incision.
Culture swabs from the incision were unremarkable and the
drainage was minimal by the day of discharge.  The patient
was not treated with antibiotics specifically targeting this
incision and dry gauze dressing was used to cover the
draining area prn.  The incision will need to be monitored
for evidence of developing or worsening infection.  The
patient's post surgical abdominal pain was managed with
Percocet one to two tablets every four to six hours as needed
for pain with good relief.  The patient had some residual
ascites by the date of discharge.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was reported to have had
an episode of pancreatitis in the immediate postoperative
period, but this was resolved by the time of the [**Hospital 874**]
transfer to the floor on postop day number five.  The patient
was started on a regular diet on postoperative day number
five and her total parenteral nutrition was discontinued.
The patient's appetite was, however, noted to be poor in the
period immediately after initiation of regular diet by mouth.
This was confirmed by a calorie count and the decision was
made to initiate cycled tube feedings on postoperative day
number eight with Mepro.  Preference was given to a low
potassium formula given the patient's hyperkalemia during
that period.  The patient's appetite remained marginal on the
day of discharge and continued tube feeding as likely to be
needed in the short term.  A calorie count on the day prior
to the patient's discharge revealed the patient was only
meeting 6% of her protein needs by mouth and only 22% of her
caloric needs.

3.  Renal:  As mentioned above the patient's acute renal
failure resolved steadily with serum creatinine falling from
a peak of 3.6 on postoperative day number three to a baseline
of about 1 by postoperative day number fifteen.

4.  Infectious disease:  The patient's stool tested positive
for C-difficile on her day of admission and [**3090-7-18**] and the
patient was started on treatment for this infection.  By
hospital day number two the day prior to surgery the
patient's stool was negative for C-difficile.  The decision
was made to keep the patient on prophylaxis against this
infection following surgery to complete a fourteen day
course.  Out of concern about the ability of her gut to
adequately absorb, the patient was double covered with po
Vancomycin and intravenous Flagyl.  C-difficile toxin
performed on postoperative day number ten were negative.  The
patient's intravenous Flagyl was discontinued and po
Vancomycin continued to postoperative day number fourteen.
The patient was also on standard post transplant prophylactic
antibiotics.  Valcyte, Bactrim and Fluconazole.

5.  Respiratory:  No issues on this admission.

6.  Hematology:  The patient required platelet transfusion on
postop day number three and seven, but by the time of
discharge her platelet count was increasing.  The patient
required transfusions for decreases in hematocrit on postop
day number fourteen and seventeen.  The patient was evaluated
for a source of bleeding, none could be identified.  Her
stool was guaiac negative.  The patient's hematocrit will
need to be monitored following discharge.

7.  Endocrine:  The patient's blood glucose levels were
controlled with insulin on a sliding scale.  Her insulin
requirements were noted to be increasing on postoperative day
number thirteen through fourteen.  Her sliding scale coverage
was increased and the [**Hospital 279**] Clinic consult team was asked to
see her.. Their recommendations included placing the patient on
six units of NPH at breakfast and dinner and continued the use of
sliding scale insulin. The patient's diabetic teaching was
deferred for fear of overwhelming the patient.  It is believed
that the patient's current high blood glucose may be attributable
to some of her immunosuppressive medications and may resolve in
two to three months.  Arrangements were made for the patient to
visit the [**Hospital 279**] Clinic for appointments on days to coincide with
her visits to the [**Hospital1 4**] Transplant
Center.  TSH level was noted to increase from 1.2 on [**3090-7-25**]
to 14 on [**3090-8-9**] and ultimately to 25 on [**3090-8-13**].  The cause
for the increase in TSH was unclear, but thyroid function
tests were drawn on the day prior to admission and follow up
is expected from the [**Hospital 279**] Clinic.  The patient was started
on a minimal dose of Synthroid at 0.125 mg q.d. to be
discontinued if this medication is deemed unnecessary.

8.  Musculoskeletal:  The patient was seen by physical
therapy following transfer to the floor from the Intensive
Care Unit and with therapy the patient was ultimately able to
ambulate safely and independently on the floor with a walker.
It is anticipated that she will continue to receive physical
therapy following discharge.

9.  Fluid and electrolytes:  The patient was noted to be
hypokalemic with serum potassium in the 5 to 7 range from
postoperative day number eight through fifteen, requiring use
of Kayexalate twice during that period, and administration of
Lasix with the duel purpose of treating hyperkalemia and
assisting in diuresis of the patient.  The patient was stable
on telemetry during the period of highest serum potassium.
The etiology for the hyperkalemia was unclear, although it
was believed that the patient's ongoing treatment with
Fluconazole, Cyclosporin and Vancomycin were contributing
factors.  The patient's potassium was down to within normal
limits by the day of discharge.  The patient was also started
on 800 mg of magnesium by mouth twice a day when her
magnesium levels were noted to be trending downward.  Her
magnesium levels will need to be monitored following
discharge.

10.  Neurological:  The patient was at times noted to be
anxious and emotionally labile by staff (intermittent crying
episodes, expressions of frustration and difficulty coping).
Neuro/psychiatric evaluation was requested prior to the
patient's discharge.  Findings from evaluation included the
fact that the patient had deficits in memory, visual planning
and organization as well as flexibility of attention and
naming and as such is prone to confusion.  The patient will
need to be followed up, preferably by a local psychiatrist in
[**Doctor Last Name 2300**]after discharge.  In the interim she will
continue to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 28**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4527**] here at the [**Hospital1 374**].

     Nausea, vomiting, increasing total bilirubin and amylase and lipase.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Pancreas/MRCP protocol.  Axial T1 in and out-of-phase; coronal
     HASTE; axial 2D time of flight with fat saturation of the portal vein; axial
     HASTE for evaluation of the bile ducts; coronal MRCP sequences; axial VIBE
     sequences pre and post- gadolinium; axial STIR; subtraction images were
     performed.  Multiplanar reconstructed images were generated and evaluated on
     the work station. Due to technical difficulty, only the venous phase VIBE
     sequence was obtained.
     
     COMPARISON:  MR [**3090-4-29**]
     
     MR ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST/MRCP:
     
     There is marked intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation involving the left and
     right lobes of the liver predominantly in the left medial segment and right
     lobe.  The degree of biliary ductal dilatation has increased from [**3090-4-29**].
     There is hypertrophy of the left lateral segment and caudate lobe which is
     unchanged.  The common bile duct is not dilated. The common bile duct has
     multiple changes in caliber, consistent with multiple strictures.  The
     pancreatic duct appears unremarkable.  There is enhancement along some dilated
     intrahepatic bile ducts but without a mass-like configuration and not
     significantly changed.  The portal vein appears attenuated but is not clearly
     delineated on this study; the visualized portion appears to have hepatopetal
     flow.  There are extensive varices.  The spleen measures 17 cm.  Minimal
     perihepatic ascites is present.  The adrenals and the visualized portion of
     the kidneys, pancreas, and gallbladder are unremarkable.
     
     Multiplanar reconstructed images were essential and delineating the anatomy
     and pathology and confirm the above stated findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Severe intrahepatic ductal dilatation and multiple common

     ONE VIEW CHEST:
     
     Comparison is made to prior study dated [**3090-7-18**].  An enteric tube is in place.
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no evidence of focal
     infiltrate.  The appearance of the pulmonary vasculature is similar to the
     film of 8/16, with no new or worsened interstitial edema.  There may be a
     small left pleural effusion.

     INDICATION:  C-difficil colitis.
     
     KUB:  There are no prior studies for comparison.  An enteric tube is in place,
     its tip in the region of the fourth duodenum.
     
     The current study is technically limited.  The bowel gas pattern is non-
     specific, with a relatively small amount of air in scattered loops of non
     dilated large bowel, and what may be a borderline dilated loop of small bowel
     in the right mid abdomen.  Note that free intraperitoneal air cannot be
     excluded on a single supine film.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Technically limited study; nonspecific gas pattern as described.

     FINDINGS:  A single AP semiupright chest image is provided.  Comparison is
     made with a supine image dated [**3090-7-29**].  The heart again shows moderate left
     ventricular enlargement.  The pulmonary vessels show minimal, if any, upper
     zone redistribution and do not indicate significant left heart failure at this
     time.  The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is satisfactorily positioned in the
     pulmonary artery trunk.  The NG tube tip is in the distal stomach.  Slight
     blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small effusion on this
     side.  No significant pulmonary infiltrates or atelectasis can be identified.
     Overlying external monitoring electrodes are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of cardiac failure at this time.  Possible small
     residual effusion at the right base. Lines in satisfactory position.

     INDICATION:  Patient is several months S/P liver transplant with fevers and
     malaise.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis without and with intravenous contrast using a liver CTA protocol.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc of Optiray IV due to fast bolus
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST FINDINGS:  The patient is
     S/P liver transplant.  There is fluid around the falciform ligament.  There is
     a focal fluid collection posterior to the right lobe of the liver, series 3A
     image #11; this fluid collection measures 4.0 x 1.5 cm.  Due to its location,
     it is not readily amenable to percutaneous drainage.
     
     There is splenomegaly.  There is a very tortuous splenic artery.  The celiac
     axis, SMA and renal arteries are grossly widely patent.  The pancreas, adrenal
     glands and kidneys are unremarkable.  The lung bases are clear.  There is a
     1cm right pericardial lymph node.
     
     ABDOMINAL CTA FINDINGS:  There is a very tortuous splenic artery.  The celiac
     axis, common hepatic, proper hepatic, left and right hepatic arteries are
     widely patent and unremarkable.  No aneurysms are identified.  There is no
     contrast extravasation.  The SMA, and renal arteries are patent and
     unremarkable.
     
     The IVC is normal in caliber.  The portal vein and splenic veins are patent.
     
     PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:  There are tortuous splenorenal
     collaterals.  There is no free fluid.  Loops of bowel are normal in contour
     and caliber.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient is several months S/P liver transplant with fevers and
     malaise.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis without and with intravenous contrast using a liver CTA protocol.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc of Optiray IV due to fast bolus
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST FINDINGS:  The patient is
     S/P liver transplant.  There is fluid around the falciform ligament.  There is
     a focal fluid collection posterior to the right lobe of the liver, series 3A
     image #11; this fluid collection measures 4.0 x 1.5 cm.  Due to its location,
     it is not readily amenable to percutaneous drainage.
     
     There is splenomegaly.  There is a very tortuous splenic artery.  The celiac
     axis, SMA and renal arteries are grossly widely patent.  The pancreas, adrenal
     glands and kidneys are unremarkable.  The lung bases are clear.  There is a
     1cm right pericardial lymph node.
     
     ABDOMINAL CTA FINDINGS:  There is a very tortuous splenic artery.  The celiac
     axis, common hepatic, proper hepatic, left and right hepatic arteries are
     widely patent and unremarkable.  No aneurysms are identified.  There is no
     contrast extravasation.  The SMA, and renal arteries are patent and
     unremarkable.
     
     The IVC is normal in caliber.  The portal vein and splenic veins are patent.
     
     PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:  There are tortuous splenorenal
     collaterals.  There is no free fluid.  Loops of bowel are normal in contour
     and caliber.
     
     CONCLUSION:  1)  No evidence of aneurysm.
     
     2)  There is a right subphrenic fluid collection as described above.  It is
     not readily amenable to CT guided aspiration or drainage due to its location.

     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the brain were obtained without IV contrast.
     
     Comparison with prior study from [**3089-11-12**].
     
     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There has been a left craniotomy for
     removal of a subdural hematoma.  There is air in the left subdural space, and
     a very small amount of residual blood.
     
     There is extensive edema of the basal ganglia and brainstem, as well as likely
     hemorrhages in the upper pons.  There is also lateral and third ventricular
     dilitation with transependymal edema. The prepontine cistern and the remaining
     basilar cisterns are obliterated.
     
     There is extensive soft tissue thickening in the ethmoidal air cells and
     maxillary sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Basal ganglionic and brainstem edema consistent with ischemia/infarction.
     Pontine hemorrhages are suspected and may be secondary to transtentorial
     herniation.  Marked hydorcephalus. Findings were discussed with surgical
     resident at the time of the exam.

     catheter, with the tip in the right main pulmonary artery. There has been
     interval placement of an NG tube, terminating within the abdomen. Again seen
     is left ventricular cardiomegaly, with slight increase in pulmonary vascular
     markings, which may be related to the patient's supine position. No
     pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Interval intubation in placement of left sided Swan-Ganz
     catheter, with its tip in right main pulmonary artery. 2) Cardiomegaly with
     increased pulmonary markings. This may be partially related to the patient's
     semi-erect positioning.

     Compared to one day earlier.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION: Subdural hemorrhage. Evaluate for pneumothorax.
     
     An endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and nasogastric tube remain in
     place. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is vascular
     engorgement and perihilar haziness. There remains some increased opacity in
     the left retrocardiac region. A right pleural effusion is seen tracking to the
     right apex.
     
     IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure pattern with associated small right
     pleural effusion.
     
     Left retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to atelectasis. Underlying
     infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
