Elective bronchoscopy

Bronchoscopy x2 with biopsy of LUL mass

Arterial Line
Central Venous Line

 
History of Present Illness:
80 year old woman with past medical history significant for 
broncheoalveolar carcinoma who was undergoing an elective 
bronchoscopy for biopsy of a LUL mass on [**2655-3-5**].  Approximately 
~45 minutes into procedure, the patient became hypertensive , 
rigid and unresponsive, with oxygen saturations falling into the 
50s.  These symptoms resolved immediately once the bronchoscope 
was removed and she was bagged.  She was given hydralazine IV 
with improvement in her SBP from 2227 to 125.  She was 
subsequently intubated for airway protection.  The patient had 
received 3.5mg versed and 100mg fentanyl over 45 minutes.  Noted 
by IP staff to be very difficult to ventillate when bagmask 
initiated.

She was transferred to the MICU with what was thought to be a 
dystonic reaction to fentanyl. She was noted to have a right 
sided neck mass after CVL placement (during which the subclavian 
artery was hit) and underwent an U/S which did not show a 
hematoma.  She was also noted to have very labile BPs with 
systolics going into the 80s after propofol.  An arterial line 
was placed.  She was briefly placed on neo with resultant SBPs 
in the 220s and then controlled on a labetolol gtt; once BPs 
were well controlled she was transitioned to po meds (norvasc, 
isordil).  She was extubated without incident on [**2656-3-6**].  She 
was also noted to have a UTI (GNR) and was started on 
ciprofloxacin.
 
Past Medical History:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Bronchoalveolar carcinoma; status post right and left
upper lobectomies.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  History of strokes and transient ischemic attacks.
5.  Parkinson disease.
6.  Claudication.
7.  Cervical myelopathy; status post anterior disc excisions
and fusions at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Osteoarthritis.
10.  Status post right total hip replacement in [**2644**].
11.  History of drop attacks; previously on Dilantin but this
was stopped and she has had no further symptoms.
12.  Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 209**] apnea; on continuous positive airway
pressure at home.
13.  Restless leg syndrome.

 
Social History:
The patient lives in assisted living in Springhouse.  She is 
widowed.  She has no children.  She smoked three quarters of a 
pack per day for 45 years; she
quit in [**2642**].  She drank wine, one to three glasses per day, for 
30 years until several months ago.  No history of illicit drug 
use.  She is a retired lawyer.

Bronch [**3-5**]
COMPLICATIONS:  Muscle rigidity secondary to Fentanyl resulting
in hypoxemia, airway obstruction and respiratory failure.

Bronch [**3-6**]
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The bronchoscope was inserted via
the endotracheal tube which terminated 2 cm proximal to the
carina.  The right-sided airways were within normal limits,
as was the trachea and left mainstem bronchus, except the
presence of severe tracheobronchomalacia.  The left lower
lobe was patent, however, the left upper lobe lingular
bronchus was completely obstructed.  Endobronchial biopsies
of the soft tissue mass were obtained and sent to pathology.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

Tissue Biopsies of LUL
pending on discharge
 
Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old woman with complicated PMH including 
broncheoalveolar carcinoma for which she was undergoing an 
elective bronchoscopy when she had an episode of rigidity, 
hypertension and desaturation attributed to a dystonic reaction 
to fentanyl and was subsequently intubated and in the MICU.  s/p 
extubation she was transferred to the floor for observation 
prior to discharge back to assisted living.

Dystonic Reaction
The patient's rigidity, desaturation and hypertension were 
thought to be due to a dystonic reaction to fentanyl.  She was 
intubated for airway protection and extubated without 
diffuculty.  She subsequently maintained her oxygen saturations 
on room air.  Fentanly was added to the patient's allergies.

Broncheoalveolar Cancer
The patient successfully underwent bronchoscopy the day after 
her dystonic reaction and biopsy specimens were obtained of her 
LUL mass.  These were pending on discharge.

Right neck mass
After right sided central line placement, complicated by 
puncture of the subclavian artery, the patient was noted to have 
a right sided neck mass.  This mass was non tender and stable in 
size, however, a neck U/S was done to rule out hematoma/aneurism 
and was negative.  This should be followed as an outpatient.

Labile BP
The patient has a history of hypertension and was on isordil and 
norvasc as an outpatient.  During her dystonic reaction her 
systolic pressure went as high as 225, she was given 10mg IV 
diltiazem with good effect and systolic pressure returning down 
to 125.  Subsequently her ICU course was complicated by lability 
in blood pressures, with systolics falling to the 80s with 
administration of propofol.  For this the patient was briefly on 
a neo gtt and pressures again went >200 for which she was on a 
labetolol gtt.  Prior to leaving the MICU her pressures were 
stabilized on her home medications and remained well controlled 
through the remainder of her stay.

UTI
In the MICU, the patient was noted to have a urinary tract 
infection growing gram negative rods.  She was started on a 7 
day course of ciprofloxacin for a complicated UTI, which grew 
out klebsiella that was pan sensitive (I to nitrofurantoin).  

Elevated Cr
Peaked at 2.2 and trended down; likely UTI and prerenal.

OSA
The patient will resume her CPAP at night on discharge (she 
declined it here).
