Admission Date:  [**2875-9-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2875-9-24**]

Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a history of
coronary artery disease who presented complaining of nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Prior to admission, the patient noted right lower quadrant
pain.  She then developed nausea and had several episodes of
vomiting which began on the afternoon of admission.  She then
went to the bathroom and noted bright red urine.  Her family
then brought her to the Emergency Department.

She arrived at the Emergency Department at approximately 3
a.m.  At this point, she complained of bilateral lower
abdominal pain which radiated into her back.  She vomited
bilious fluid in the Emergency Department times one.  At the
time, she denied any chest pain.  She denied any shortness of
breath, fevers, or chills.

She was sent for an abdominal computed tomography which
showed a 5-cm X 4-cm abscess within the portal system of the
liver as well as trabeculation and wall thickening in the
bladder consistent with cystitis.

While in the process of being evaluated, the patient
developed progressive shortness of breath and an oxygen
desaturation down to the 80%.  She was emergently intubated
for hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress.
Subsequent to intubation, the patient developed hemoptysis with
profuse blood coming from the endotracheal tube, requiring
extensive suctioning.  She was sent for an emergent chest
computed tomography which revealed marked pulmonary parenchymal
consolidation consistent with a pulmonary hemorrhage.

Multiple attempts to obtain blood for laboratory analysis
were attempted; however, all samples drawn were severely
hemolyzed and unable to be processed by the laboratory.
Laboratories were again attempted but continued to be
markedly hemolyzed.  An arterial blood gas was obtained which
showed her hematocrit to be 15 with a pH initially of 7.19
which had dropped to 6.87.  Further laboratories were unable
to be obtained at this time given her hemolysis.

Given her clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, there
was concern that the patient was in massive disseminated
intravascular coagulation.  An emergent Hematology
consultation was obtained.  In addition, an emergent Surgery
Service consultation was obtained to evaluate for hepatic
abscess for possible surgical intervention.

Transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was arranged for
further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Coronary artery disease (with exertional angina).
4.  Hypothyroidism; status post partial thyroidectomy in [**2866**]
for a thyroid nodule.
5.  Cardiac catheterization in [**2872**] with 80% stenosis of the
first diagonal.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Home medications included Norvasc,
atenolol, Imdur, aspirin, Levoxyl, and Celebrex.

ALLERGIES:  NIACIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a retired pharmacist who
immigrated to the United States in [**2865-10-16**] with her
son and granddaughter.  No tobacco or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of coronary artery
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission with vital signs which revealed the patient was
afebrile, her blood pressure was 123/67, her heart rate was
86, her respiratory rate was 15 times per minute per
ventilator with a tidal volume of 650 mL, positive
end-expiratory pressure of 5, and oxygen saturation of 92% on
an FIO2 of 100%.  In general, the patient was an obese female
who was intubated and sedated.  She was unresponsive.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were
sluggish.  There was an endotracheal tube in place with
extensive blood exsanguinating from the endotracheal tube.
Pulmonary examination revealed coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was soft and distended.  There
were positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
the extremities were cool.  There were intermittent faint
radial pulses.  The dorsalis pedis pulses were not
dopplerable.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count was
56.6, her hematocrit was 15, and her platelets were 277.
Differential revealed 65% neutrophils, 15% basophils, 16%
lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 2% metamyelocytes, 1% myelocyte,
and 2% nucleated red blood cells.  The patient's lactate was
8.3.  Urinalysis with large blood, 0 to 2 red blood cells,
positive nitrites, and moderate leukocytes.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
sinus rhythm at 87 beats per minute.  There were ST
depressions in leads I, II, and V2 through V6; consistent
with a strained pattern.  There were T waves in lead III.
There were T wave inversions in leads II and aVF.

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates and lower
lobe consolidations.

A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed
bilateral lower lobe consolidation, 5-cm X 4-cm air-filled
abscess in the liver, and mild pneumobilia.

A computed tomography of the chest without contrast revealed
bilateral lower lobe consolidation.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  LIVER ABSCESS ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with
right upper quadrant pain with a subsequent abdominal
computed tomography showing a liver abscess with air in the
abscess and biliary tree.  Blood cultures, urine cultures,
and sputum cultures were sent.  The patient subsequently
developed a clinical picture concerning for sepsis with
disseminated intravascular coagulation.  She was aggressively
treated with Levaquin, Flagyl, and vancomycin.  She was
aggressively hydrated.

The Surgery Service was emergently consulted to see if she
might benefit from drainage of the abscess.  The surgical consult
team felt the patient was not a surgical consult secondary to
hemodynamic instability and severe coagulopathy. It was thought
that she might benefit from percutaneous drainage of her liver
abscess should she stabilize clinically to the point where
she would tolerate and Interventional Radiology procedure.

The patient continued to decompensate despite aggressive
treatment of her sepsis including aggressive fluid
resuscitation and pressors.

2.  DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION ISSUES:  The
patient was admitted with complaints of hematuria.  She soon
developed a septic picture with concern for disseminated
intravascular coagulation.  Her blood was massively hemolyzed
to the point where laboratory analysis was unable to be
obtained.

The patient also developed massive hemoptysis, and a computed
tomography of the chest was concerning for massive pulmonary
hemorrhage.  The patient was aggressively transfused with
packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and
cryoprecipitate to counter her disseminated intravascular
coagulation.  Specimens continued to be sent in an attempt to
obtain coagulations or fibrinogen.  An emergent Hematology
Service consultation was obtained.  They concurred with
aggressive transfusions.

Despite aggressive care, the patient's hematocrit further
dropped from 15 to 10.5; presumably due to her massive
hemoptysis, hematuria, and hemolysis.  In addition, her
abdomen became progressively distended raising concern for
hemorrhage into the abdomen.

3.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient developed acute
respiratory distress in the Emergency Department with
hypoxia, necessitating intubation.  She subsequently
developed massive hemoptysis.  A computed tomography of the
chest showed pulmonary consolidations consistent with a
pulmonary hemorrhage.

Due to her hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe pulmonary
hemorrhage presumed secondary to disseminated intravascular
coagulation, the patient was maintained on mechanical
ventilation. Despite adjustments of the ventilatory settings, and
positive end-expiratory pressure, and increase of the FIO2 to
100%, the patient continued to have transient hypoxia.  She
continued to have massive hemoptysis despite aggressive
suctioning.

4.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient presented
with hematuria.  A computerized axial tomography of the
pelvis showed trabeculae and bladder wall thickening;
consistent with cystitis.  Her urinalysis did show
leukocytes.  There was concern for possible urosepsis which
could have been contributing to her other problems.  She was
maintained on Levaquin, Flagyl, and vancomycin for broad
spectrum antibiotic coverage.

5.  PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY ISSUES:  Following
admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was
aggressively treated with aggressive transfusions and fluid
resuscitation.  She continued to decompensate clinically.
She then went into a rhythm of pulseless electrical activity.

A code was called, and the patient was treated per pulseless
electrical activity protocol.  She briefly had return of a
wide irregular rhythm and pulse, but was unable to
sustain a blood pressure.  She subsequently went into
pulseless electrical activity again.  She then went into
aystole.  The patient was aggressively coded for
greater than 45 minutes with no clinical response.

Given the medical futility of further cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, the code was ended at this point.  The
patient's family members were aware and in agreement with
cessation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation at this point.
The patient's family agreed to a postmortem examination.

     INDICATION:  82 y/o female with abdominal pain and hematuria. Evaluate for
     perforation, free fluid, and evaluate abdominal aorta.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of abdomen and pelvis performed before and after the IV
     administration of 100 cc Optiray. Nonionic contrast used secondary to
     patient's debility. No comparison studies on PACS.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND W/O CONTRAST:  There is extensive consolidation within
     both lung bases with primary parenchymal opacity and air bronchograms in both
     loewr lobes.  There is a 5.0 x 4.0 cm abscess in segment 6 of the liver. The
     liver is otherwise normal in contour and attenuation.  The portal and hepatic
     veins are patent.  There is probable portal venous gas which is transiently
     present.  No gallbladder is identified.  No evidence of intra or extrahepatic
     biliary ductal dilatation.  There is atrophic pancreas with no pancreatic mass
     identified. The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There is an NG
     tube with distal tip within the distal stomach.  The abdominal aorta is of
     normal caliber throughout. The proximal SMA is patent.  There is a small
     caliber celiac axis which is patent. There is a separate common hepatic artery
     originating from the aorta which is patent. There is no free air or free fluid
     within the abdomen or pelvis. There is no abnormal dilatation or wall
     thickening within small bowel. There is questionable thickening of the colon
     at the splenic flexure.  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast promptly and
     symmetrically with no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal mass. There is a
     contour abnormality of the right kidney likely related to old inflmmatory
     change. There is a simple cyst within the mid pole of the left kidney.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is an irregular surface with evidence of
     trabeculation within the wall of the urinary bladder. No evidence of bladder
     leak.  The patient's atrophic postmenopausal uterus is unremarkable. There is
     no evidence of adnexal mass.  The rectum is within normal limits.  The
     appendix is nondilated and filled with air.  There is no evidence of
     inflammatory change within the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS show no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS were reformatted in the coronal plane and essential in
     evaluating the urinary bladder as well as large and small bowel and
     demonstrates no evidence of obstruction.

     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) 5.0 x 4.0 cm abscess within segment 6 of liver.
     2) Portal venous air which was transiently present within a non dependent,
     peripheral portion of the liver.  This likely reflects low flow mesenteric
     ischemia as the SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are patent.  There is also questionably thickened
     wall within a segment of colon at the splenic flexure.  
     3) Marked pulmonary parenchymal consolidation within both lower lobes.
     4) No evidence of free air, free fluid, ileus or obstruction.
