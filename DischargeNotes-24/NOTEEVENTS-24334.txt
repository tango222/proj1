Admission Date:  [**2512-12-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2513-1-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2463-11-11**]     Sex:  M

Service:  GENERAL SURGERY

COMPLICATIONS:  Myocardial infarction and death.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 49 year-old
male who had no significant past medical history except for
chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension who was
transferred from an outside hospital after sustaining a
hemorrhagic stroke in the left basal ganglia causing symptoms
of right hemiplegia on [**2512-12-28**].  He was admitted to
the Neurology Service for management of his hemorrhagic
stroke.  Subsequently his renal insufficiency worsened and he
subsequently went into renal failure, which required
hemodialysis.  Over the following week and a half he was
managed on multiple antihypertensive regimens in the
Intensive Care Unit and was stabilized and transferred to the
floor on [**1-6**].  He was receiving prophylaxis, stress
peptic ulcer prophylaxis on Protonix.  On [**1-7**], the
patient complained of acute abdominal pain during dialysis
and an upright chest x-ray was obtained.  He was noted to
have free air and was brought to the Operating Room
emergently.  He was found on exploration to have a perforated
sigmoid colon secondary to diverticulitis with an abscess.
The patient was resected and immediately after his resection
he suffered a cardiac arrest and developed PEA on the
Operating Room table.  His abdomen was closed rapidly without
maturation of his colostomy and he was brought to the
Intensive Care Unit on pressors for resuscitation.

He ruled in for a massive myocardial infarction with peak
troponins over 5 and CKMBs over 1000.  The plan had been to
return him to the Operating Room for completion of his
colostomy, however, given that his cardiac status was so
severe after consultation with cardiology consult we decided
to wait until the following day before taking him back to the
Operating Room given the stress to his heart.  However, on
postop day number three the day we had planned on returning
him to the Operating Room for his colostomy, he suffered
another cardiac arrest.  He was given multiple intravenous
medications and ACLS protocol was initiated.  He was coded
for approximately thirty minutes before expiring.

Autopsy revealed death caused by acute myocardial infarction.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  Hypertension and left basal ganglia bleed. R/O infarction.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted imaging of the brain was performed.
      Diffusion weighted imaging is included.
     3D time of flight angiography of the Circle of [**Location (un) 309**] is also performed.
     Mutliplanar reformatted images of the cerebral vasculature are provided.
     
     MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  There is a very large left cerebral hemorrhage centered
     in the putamen and extending into the insula.  There is flattening of the left
     lateral ventricular body.  There is narrowing of the left Sylvian fissure.
     Minimal midline shift is present at this time.  The basal cisternal spaces are
     well visualized.  There is no evidence of restricted diffusion in this area to
     suggest infarction beyond the area of hemorrhage.  There are no other areas of
     acute or chronic infarction evident.  Cortical signal is preserved throughout.
      There are a few tiny foci of white matter T2 signal hyperintensity, which is
     a non-specific finding of uncertain clinical significance.  There is blood in
     the lateral ventricles.  The ventricles are not dilated.
     
     There are flow voids in the major branches of the Circle of [**Location (un) 309**].
     
     There is fluid in the ethmoid air cells.
     
     MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1337**] normal flow signal in the  major branches of the
     Circle of [**Location (un) 309**], including the intracranial vertebral arteries, basilar
     artery and proximal portions of the posterior cerebral and superior cerebral
     arteries.  There is flow in the intracranial carotid arteries and the proximal
     portions of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries.  Sylvian branches of
     the middle cerebral arteries are not completely visualized.  No arterial
     venous malformations or aneurysms are identified.  There may be a basilar
     artery fenestration, which is a morphologic variant.
     
     IMPRESSION: There is a large cerebral hemorrhage centered in the left basal
     ganglia.  No acute or old infarction is evident within the brain.  No vascular
     abnormalities are detected on the MRA of Circle of [**Location (un) 309**], though Sylvian
     branches are incompletely viewed.

     AP CHEST:  Comparison to [**2512-12-31**] demonstrates interval removal of the ET tube
     and NG tube.  The right IJ catheter is still in appropriate position.  There
     is slight tracheal narrowing at the level of the thoracic inlet.  This could
     be related to recent intubation.  There is an enlarged cardiac silhouette that
     is not significantly changed.  There is haziness to the right lower lung field
     that likely represents a right layering pleural effusion.  There is also
     probable subpulmonic effusion on the left.  The pulmonary vascularity appears
     normal.  There is left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.  The extreme left
     costophrenic angle is not included on the film.  Osseous structures are
     unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Status post extubation with slight tracheal narrowing at the
     level of the thoracic inlet.  This may be due to the recent intubation.
     
     2)  Bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     3)  Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation which may be related to atelectasis

     regardless of radiograph orientation the feeding tube tip appears to overlie
     the stomach. There appears to be a catheter within what is labeled as the left

     ABDOMINAL SERIES [**2513-1-7**]
     
     Two views of the abdomen are submitted for interpretation and reviewed in
     conjunction with a chest radiograph obtained at approximately the same time.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Abdominal distention.
     
     On the accompanying chest radiograph, there is evidence for a large amount of
     free intraperitoneal air.
     
     A feeding tube is present, terminating in the region of the distal stomach.
     
     A nonobstructed bowel gas pattern is seen.  Note is made of thickening of the
     wall of the colon predominantly in the ascending and transverse portions.
     
     Degenerative changes are evident in the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Large amount of free intraperitoneal air seen on accompanying chest
     radiograph which is dictated separately.  This is concerning for a perforated
     abdominal viscus in the absence of recent surgical intervention in the
     abdomen.  This finding has been communicated to the referring clinical
     physician on the date of the exam.
     2.  Bowel wall thickening in the ascending and transverse portions of the
     colon.  This could be due to ischemia, hemorrhage, edema or infection.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     TWO VIEW CHEST [**2513-1-7**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Low grade temperature.  Status post stroke.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of [**2513-1-3**].
     
     There is evidence of a large amount of free intraperitoneal air below the
     hemidiaphragms.
     
     The heart is enlarged and there is slight vascular engorgement and perihilar
     haziness.  There is some elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with associated
     crowding of the vessels in the right base.  Previously present pleural
     effusions appear improved.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Large amount of free intraperitoneal air, as communicated to the clinical
     service caring for the patient.  In the absence of recent surgical
     intervention in the abdomen, this is highly concerning for a perforated
     abdominal viscus.
     2.  Mild fluid overload.
     3.  Improved pleural effusions.

     INDICATION: Status post bilateral chest tube placement and Swan placement,
     assess tubes.
     
     FINDINGS: A single portable chest radiograph is compared with the PA and
     lateral study done 8 hours earlier. An endotracheal tube is in appropriate
     position below the thoracic inlet. A right sided and a left sided chest tube
     both also appear to be in appropriate position. The Swan-Ganz catheter
     terminates appropriately in the interlobar artery. No evidence for pneumo-
     thorax. There is decreased appearance of pulmonary edema compared with the
     prior examination. No free air is currently identified below the diaphragms
     on this film.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Appropriately positioned lines and tubes. No evidence for
     pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  Check ET tube and line positions.
     
     Comparison film from two days prior.
     
     AP CHEST:  Chest tubes are seen in both hemithoraces with the tips in the mid
     lung zones.  A SG catheter entering from the left has its tip in a right
     interlobar artery.  A right IJ catheter is seen with its tip in the mid SVC.
     ET tube tip is 6 cm above the crina.  A NG tube and feeding tube are seen
     coursing below the diaphragm; however their tips are not included on the film.
      There is stable LV enlargement. Behind the heart in the left lower lobe there
     is suggestion of an ill-defined infiltrate adjacent to the spine. This may
     represent consolidation or collapse.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.
     There is no definite evidence of failure or effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Lines and tubes in appropriate position.
     
     2. Left lower lobe ill-defined opacity that may represent collapse or
     consolidation.
