     TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast head CT.
     
     CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  There is hyperattenuating material consistent with
     subarachnoid blood overlying the right frontal, right temporal as well as the
     left temporal lobes.  There is a moderate amount of intraparenchymal blood
     within the right frontal lobe consistent with a contusion.  There is also
     intraparenchymal blood within the frontal and temporal lobes bilaterally,
     consistent with contusions.  There is a small amount of subarachnoid blood
     layering along the tentorium posteriorly and bilaterally consistent with small
     subdural hematomas. The [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-white matter differentiation appears intact
     throughout. There are also tiny, 6-7 mm, isodense extraaxial collections
     bilaterally. These may represent sub-acute subdural hematomas.  The [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-white
     matter differentiation appears intact throughout.  There is no evidence of
     hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
     
     Bone windows show multiple fractures through the left temporal bone extending
     into the left occipital bone as well as extending anteriorly into the dorsum
     sella and left sphenoid.  There is opacification of the left external auditory
     canal, representing either blood and/or mucosal thickening.  There are also
     fractures of the right lamina papyracea and right frontal bone.  There is
     intraorbital emphysema and a hematoma along the medial wall of the right
     orbit.  There is also pneumocephalus posterior to the right frontal bone as
     well as within the right middle cranial fossa. There is opacification of the
     ethmoid and sphenoid air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage over the right temporal lobe, right frontal lobe
     and left temporal lobe.

Admission Date: [**2925-4-11**]        Discharge Date: [**2925-4-12**]

Date of Birth:  [**2867-3-2**]        Sex:  M

Service:  MED


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Status post fall.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Anterior parenchymal hemorrhage.
3. Respiratory compromise, ventilator dependent.
4. Hypovolemia requiring central venous line.
5. Hypotension requiring Neo-Synephrine.
6. Increased intracranial pressure requiring ventriculostomy
   drain.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 57-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for Down
syndrome who was status post an unwitnessed fall down 12
stairs.  The patient was unresponsive with [**Doctor Last Name 314**] matter coming
out of his left ear.  He vomited on arrival to the Emergency
Room at [**Hospital3 2518**] and was emergently intubated.  The
patient was transferred by ambulance to [**Hospital1 182**] Emergency Room for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Down syndrome.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not available.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Cogentin.
2. Zyprexa.
3. Flomax.
4. Seldene.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient was
afebrile.  His heart rate was in the 80's initially and then
in the 40's after Neo-Synephrine was started.  His blood
pressure was in the low 100's.  He was satting 100 percent.
His GCS was 60.  He had [**Doctor Last Name 314**] matter coming out of his left
ear with blood.  His pupils were 5 mm and nonreactive.  His
heart was regular.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft and non-distended.  His back was negative.
His extremities were without obvious deformities.  His rectal
tone was normal.  He was guaiac negative.  Back non-tender,
no step-offs.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit 36, INR 1.3, lactate
2.1, tox screen negative.  ABG essentially normal.

RADIOLOGY:  CT of his head revealed a right frontal
subarachnoid hemorrhage and temporal lobe subarachnoid
hemorrhage as well as a left temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage
with multiple skull fractures.  CT of cervical spine also
showed grade 2 anterolisthesis on C7-T1.  His chest x-ray was
normal.  His pelvic x-ray was negative.  His CT of the
abdomen and pelvis was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Intensive Care Unit.  Ventriculostomy was obtained and ICPs
were monitored.  Given his low cerebral perfusion pressure he
was started on Neo-Synephrine to maintain his blood pressure.
He was given intravenous fluids for resuscitation.  His
neurological examination remained stable; however, he did not
become any more responsive.  Neurosurgery was consulted and
felt that he was stable.  They recommended keeping his blood
pressure normotensive and keeping him euvolemic.  Given the
patient's grave prognosis a discussion was had with the
patient's next-of-[**Doctor First Name **] and it was decided that the patient
would be made comfort measures only.  The patient expired at
1:39.  The case was accepted by the Medical Examiner.

     HISTORY:  Central line and endotracheal tube placement.
     
     AP SUPINE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.  The left
     subclavian central venous catheter is in the distal left brachycephalic vein.
     No pneumothorax.  There are bilateral patchy opacities, concentrated in the
     perihilar region and extending to the periphery.  These could represent
     contusions in the setting of trauma vs. pulmonary edema.  No pleural
     effusions.  The cardiac contour is at the upper limits of normal in size.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Satisfactory ET tube placement.
     
     2. Left central venous catheter is in the left brachycephalic vein.
     
     3. Patchy bilateral infiltrates, which could represent contusions vs.
     pulmonary edema.  Follow up is recommended.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Basilar skull fracture.  Evaluate for vascular injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Head CT without contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2925-4-11**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The appearance of the CT is unchanged.  Again seen is subarachnoid
     blood overlying the right frontal, right temporal, and left temporal lobes.
     Intraparenchymal blood within the right frontal lobe consistent with a
     contusion is also present.  Intraparenchymal blood within the frontal temporal
     lobes bilaterally is seen.  Small subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen layering
     along the tentorium posteriorly and bilaterally consistent with small subdural
     hematomas.  There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline
     structures.  Multiple facial fractures are seen.  Please refer to the CT
     report from [**2925-4-11**] for further details.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of the head CT.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 309**] with multiplanar and volume
     rendering.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is narrowing of both vertebral arteries and there is
     narrowing of the left internal carotid artery from the bifurcation onward
     throughout the course of the vessel. There is no area of significant stenosis
     or aneurysmal dilatation.  Within the limits of coverage of this study, no
     sign of an arteriovenous malformation is apparent.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Narrowing of both vertebral and left internal carotid arteries.
     Although this could be congenital in the setting of trauma, further evaluation
     with MRA could be helpful.
