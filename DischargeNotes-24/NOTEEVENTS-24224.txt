     INDICATION: Metastatic follicular thyroid cancer assessment of interval
     disease progression.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple contiguous slices were obtained from the lung apices to
     the pubic symphysis after administration of 150 cc of Optiray due to language
     barrier.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT of the chest with contrast: There is evidence of soft tissue defect in the
     neck post thyroidectomy. There is no evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy.
     There is evidence of lung mass in the left upper lobe that measures 1.8 x 2.9
     cm and extends to a conglomerate of lymph nodes in the aortopulmonary window
     that measure 1.5 and 1.7 cm in diameter. There is evidence of right hilar
     lymphadenopathy that measures 1.5 x 2.7 cm. It extends into the right main
     bronchus with an endobronchial mass that occupies almost the entire right
     main bronchus. The endoluminal component measures 1.9 x 1.9 cm. There is
     evidence of slight volume loss of the right lung compared to a a prior CT from
     [**3482-7-18**].
     
     There are multiple lung nodules in both lobes in the right upper lobe the
     largest lesion measures 1.4 cm in diameter. There are tiny 5 mm nodules in the
     right lower lobe and in the right mid lobe.
     
     In comparison with the prior CT from [**3482-7-18**] there is increase in the size of
     the lung nodules as well as a new
     intrabronchial mass in the right main bronchus.
     
     CT of the abdomen with and without contrast: There is no evidence of focal
     liver masses or abnormalities. There is no intra or extrahepatic bile duct
     dilatation. The pancreas and spleen are within normal limits. There is a 1.4
     cm adenoma of the right adrenal. There are cysts on the kidneys the largest
     one in the right upper lobe that measures 4.1 cm in diameter. Smaller cysts
     are also noted but some of the smaller ones cannot be fully characterized due
     to their small size. There is no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT of the pelvis with contrast: There is no evidence of pelvic anomalies or
     lymphadenopathy. There is no evidence of pelvic fluid.

ADDENDUM:  Please note that during the last two days of the
hospital course the patient became more conversant, and after
an extensive discussion with her family members, the
interpreter, and the social workers the patient decided that
she wanted to be full code.

At that time the do not resuscitate/do not intubate code
status was reversed, and the patient was sent to the [**Hospital3 3924**] with a code status of full code.  The patient clearly
indicated that if the patient was to decompensate the patient
would want everything done to her.

     CHEST, PORTABLE AP: There is interval placement of ET tube, with the tip about
     2 cm above the carina. There is also noted an NG tube. There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax. There is significant volume loss in the right lung. There is
     complete opacification in the lower two-thirds of the right lung. The left
     lung demonstrates a tiny soft tissue density at the right base, which could
     represent a granuloma versus pulmonary nodule versus a small pulmonary vessel.
     The left lung is otherwise clear. There is also a possible right-sided pleural
     effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: Status post ET tube placement, with tip about 2 cm agove the

     CHEST, AP BEDSIDE:  There is an ET tube in position, 2 cm above the carina.
     There is evidence of significant volume loss of the right lung and mediastinal
     shift to the right which likely reflects the intrabronchial mass within the
     right main bronchus, described on CT of [**3482-12-11**].  There is a right-sided
     pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of heart failure.  There is a small
     opacity within the left peripheral lung base.  There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax.  The soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  ET tube placement with distal tip 2 cm above the carina. No
     evidence of pneumothorax.  Evidence of opacification and volume loss involving
     the right lung, secondary to a previously described right main stem bronchus
     lesion.

     cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged. The well localized opacity at the
     right apex, likely consistent with localized component of a right sided
     pleural effusion, is unchanged. Lateral and basal components of prior right
     effusion are decreased. Linear and interstitial densities within the right
     middle and right lower lung zones are consistent with residual atelectasis.
     Also noted are linear densities within the left upper lung field with
     associated elevation of the left hilum, likely representing left upper lobe
     atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is no left sided
     effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Interval pull back of right sided subclavian central venous
     line into good position. 2) Interval improvement of right sided atelectasis
     and/or consolidation. Otherwise, unchanged findings.

Micu Progress Nursing Note:

79 year-old Russian-speaking female with history of advanced metastatic papillary thyroid ca, thought to be caused by Chernobly exposure. She presented with a 6 week history before admission of increasing shortness of breath, with cough. Patient is s/p thyroidectomy in [**3472**] with radical neck disection, s/p xrt, multiple courses of radioactive iodine treatment. Pulmonary mets were diagnosed via CT in [**3480**]. She has a 1.9 x 1.9 cm endobronchial mass that occupies almost the entire right stem bronchus. There is a mass in the LUL and multiple nodules right lung. She was emergently intubated in the ER for resp distress, drop in sats to the 70s. Patient had rigid bronch in OR on [**12-25**] with stent placement in R middle stem and distal portion of trachea. Patient was extubated on [**12-26**] at 1800. Plan is to 
see how patient does extubated and to reintubate if she does not do well. She is currently a full code.

Neuro: Does not respond to questions. Non-verbal. Very restless all shift, pupils 2mm and sluggish. No response to noxious stimuli, eg: sternal rub or nail pressure. She was placed back on Fentanyl gtt for increased agitation, titrated to sedation, up to 30mics, with several boluses. She did receive 2 50 microgram boluses of Fentanyl before the drip was re-started, and .5 of Ativan ivp, with minimal effect. The Fentanyl gtt was dc'd mid-shift for a drop in pressure and increasing sedation, although it was restarted at 5 mics at 0415 for periods of agitation and increased BP. 

CV: Remains in afib with occasional PVCs. Potassium was checked x 2 with blood gases and has come back 3.9 x 2. BP 130s to 170s over 60s to 90s. HR 90s down to 60s. Some pedal edema, non-pitting. Hands are somewhat puffy as well. Pedal pulses are palpable. IV changed to D51/2 NS. 

Resp: Received on face mask at 70%. Irregular breathing pattern, rate teens to 20s. Expiratory wheezes throughout. Received neb treatments per RT. Patient placed on CPap mask ventilation after patient found grey, circumoral cyanosis, needing nasal-tracheal suctioning for moderate to large amount of thick tan secretions, some blood-tinged secretions. PS originally 12 increased to 14 after first blood gas. Please see carevue for blood gases. 

GI/GU: Patient with positive bowel sounds, abdomen somewhat distended. NPO. Foley draining good amounts of dilute pale yellow urine until ~0300 when urine output slowed down to 15-20cc/hr. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 266**] made aware. Will continue to follow and assess further after foley is flushed. No stool. 

ID: T-max 101 rectally. MD aware. Will not culture unless temp reaches 101.5 or greater. Remains on multiple antibiotics. 

Plan: Continue to follow resp. status. Continue ongoing discussions with family regarding code status, plan of care.

Respiratory Care:

Patient given Albuterol/Atrovent neb with mask. Tolerated well. Bs expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Wheezes resolved with rx.  Pt. requiring mask ventilation later in shift for resp distress. Sx'd via nurse. O2 sats decreasing to mid 80's. Pt. put on NRM with O2 sats increasing to 96%. Still with increased labored breathing pattern. Albuterol/Atrovent neb given without change. Bs with some expiratory wheezes.  Patient rested  on mask ventilation with good results. Tolerated well. Bs high pitch upper airway noises. Epi neb given x1 in line with mask ventilation. No immediate change but resolving over course of shift. Abg improving. Pt. taken off this am and put on 70% cool neb. Abg results 7.41, 50, 120, 33. RR comfortable. No further changes made. Continue with cool neb. Mask ventilation on standby.

     HISTORY: Cough.
     
     CHEST PA AND LATERAL:  Comparison with reports from recent chest studies at
     [**Hospital1 550**]-[**Location (un) 551**] in [**3481**] and early 2003.
     
     There is mild cardiomegaly.  There are no focal infiltrates.  There is a 3 cm
     upper lobe mass just above the level of the hilum.  There is extensive right-
     sided mediastinal adenopathy.  There is a stent in the SVC.  There is no
     effusion or bone destruction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive adenopathy and mass in the left upper lobe.  Findings
     are consistent with patient's known metastatic disease.

     Reason: Assess for atelectasis
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      80 year old woman with hx of thyroid ca and RUL stent for obstruction
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Assess for atelectasis
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     TWO VIEW CHEST:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Thyroid cancer.  Right upper lobe stent placement.
     
     Comparison is made to digitized chest x-ray of [**3483-5-4**].
     
     Tracheal and right main stem bronchial stents are present.  Allowing for
     differences in technique, these are not significantly changed in the interval.
     There is widening at the right mediastinal contour as well as abnormal
     enlargement and rounded contour of the right hilum.  The right mediastinal
     widening appears similar in the interval but the right hilar enlargement
     appears new.  There is also a rounded configuration of the left hilar contour
     which appears new in the interval.  There is partial atelectasis of the right
     upper lobe centrally adjacent to the right mediastinal widening.  This is
     similar compared to the previous exam.  The remaining portions of the lungs
     demonstrate no significant atelectatic changes.  No pleural effusions are
     identified.  Degenerative changes are seen in the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Widening of right mediastinal and hilar contours consistent with
     neoplastic involvement of the lymph nodes in these regions.  There is
     associated partial atelectasis of the right upper lobe centrally adjacent to
     the right mediastinal mass.  However, the majority of the right upper lobe is
     well aerated with the minor fissure in a normal anatomic location.
     
     The right hilar enlargement is new in the interval and there is also increased
     rounded contour of the left hilum, concerning for progressive lymphadenopathy.
     Correlative CT could be obtained for more complete assessment if clinically
     warranted.
