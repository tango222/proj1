(3) appear  
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
regurgitation.  
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mitral 
regurgitation is  
present but cannot be quantified. Tricuspid regurgitation is 
present but  
cannot be quantified. There is at least moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic  
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**10-4**] U/S with dopplers
IMPRESSION:
1. Extremely limited study due to patient body habitus.
2. Distended gallbladder with sludge.
3. Fatty liver. Main and right portal veins are patent.
4. Increased ascites.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Oliguric Renal Failure:  Initially patient was thought to be 
prerenal vs HRS, and FENA was consistent with this.  The patient 
was hydrated with NaHCO, cautiously, and was started on 
hepotorenal medications including octreotide, midodrine, and 
albumin.  Urine output transiently increased, but unclear if 
this was d/t hydration or HRS treatment, as both occurred 
simultaneously.  Additionally, foley was found to be in urethra 
on HD #2 and once this was replaced, urine output increased 
transiently.  However, the patient continued to have poor urine 
output even in the setting of adequate BP.  CVVH was started in 
setting of uremia.  Repeat FENA suggested ATN, but it was 
questionable how accurate this was in the setting of CVVH.  
There was some concern for right ventricular dysfunction in the 
face of pulmonary hypertension, and an ECHO was performed.  This 
showed mod pulm HTN based on TR gradient of 45, but right 
ventricle was not well visualized d/t patient's habitus.  CXR 
demonstrated a widened mediastinum that was concerning for 
congestion.  Because the patient's fluid status was not 
completely clear and because there was some concern for hepatic 
congestion by renal and total body fluid overload, 50cc/hr was 
removed with CVVH.  Cr intermittently trended down with CVVH but 
then trended upwards.  Treatment for HRS was continued, but 
patient was unable to get midodrine for ~1day as he was 
aspirating meds and it was very difficult to pass an NGT.  
Patient remained oliguric until death. 
.
# Transaminitis: Pt had evidence of non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis and presumed drug injury on previous biopsy and 
demonstrated continued worsening of synthetic funtion based upon 
INR and bilirubin.  No clear etiology of acute liver 
decompensation was found.  Liver U/S from [**10-2**] showed no 
thrombosis of portal or hepatic veins and little ascites, and 
this was repeated with no change.  There may have been a small 
element of hepatic congestion, but this was not the cause of the 
acute decompensation as the LFT's would have been more elevated. 
 Although the patient had already had a full workup for acute 
liver disease, repeat workup was performed with CMV, EBV, and 
Hep serologies, all of which were negative.  No cause for acute 
liver decompensation was determined, and the patient became 
progressively more encephalopathic.  He was treated with 
lactulose for encephalopathy, but did not receive this for ~1 
day d/t poor PO access.  An arterial ammonia level was obtained 
and was moderately elevated
.
# Septicemia - The patient did not have fevers or a white count 
on presentation or for the majority of his ICU stay.  Because 
his mental status was deteriorating and white count jumped up, 
blood cultures were taken on [**10-4**] which showed GPC in clusters, 
which later grew out coagulase negative staph, and broad 
spectrum antibiotics were started.  However, over the course of 
the following day he rapidly became hypotensive, febrile, and 
tachycardic.  He was found to by hypoxic with PaO2 78 and 
adidemic with pH 7.1 and was intubated.  His lactate trended 
from 1.4 to 11.4 within 16 hours, and his hypotension progressed 
to the point or requiring 3 different pressors to maintain MAPs. 
 A discussion was held with his wife and she made him CMO in the 
face of rapid deterioration, overwhelming sepsis, acute 
worsening liver disease of unknown etiology, and renal failure.  
Pressors were withdrawn and the patient expired shortly 
thereafter from cardiac and respiratory arrest.    
.
# Cardiology - Last ECHO on record at [**Hospital1 23**] with EF>50% in [**3086**] 
with dilated LA and symmetric LVH, right heart not seen, and 
cardiac cath in [**3087**] with normal coronary arteries and mild 
pulmonary HTN (PCWP 20, PAP 20, RA 13).  Repeat ECHO with mod 
pulm HTN, LVH, normal EF.  After initial resuscitation with 
fluids, renal was consulted and started CVVH with goal to remove 
50cc/hr in setting of ?right heart failure.  
.
#FEN - The patient was found to aspirate liquids and meds, and 
an NGT was placed and he was made NPO.  A speech and swallolw 
was planned but never obtained.
.
# [**Doctor Last Name **] Apnea: Used CPAP continuously, both at night and during 
the day, until intubation. 
.
# Type II Diabetes: Continued on outpatient NPH and sliding 
scale with fingersticks.
.
# HTN: After fluid resuscitation remained normotensive until day 
of death.  Home dose of valsartan was held.  
.
# Psych: History of anxiety, depression.  Former alcoholic but 
had not had drink in many years.  Was continue lexapro 5 mg QPM.

Pt adm with SOB and weakness, BUN/Cr up to 116/6.5 c uremic symptoms of lethargy, nausea, wretching, asterexis, metabolic acidosis, probably acute on chronic RF , also c liver failure from NASH and some drug caused injury reported from liver biopsy.  Pt on CPAP at home for [**Doctor Last Name **] apnea and COPD, continued here.  Pt received dialysis IJ cath at IR today, and A-line placed this eve, successful after 3 attempts.  CVVHDF started on pt at 1845.

Review of symptoms:

CV:  BP 80s this am, pt hypotensive prob from liver failure.  Pt received >3L fld today for mult fld boluses of Dext c 150meq bicarb for ? dehydration, 2L FFP for INR>5 and pt needed line placement, and 12.5 gm 50% albumin.  Pt responded well to this fld c SBP up to 120s-130s.  HR 50s-60s this am, SB/nsr.  this afternoon up to 70s, nsr c occ pacs.  Pt afebrile, tmax 96.3, nl wbc, hct good at 31.5.

Resp:  LS clear, diminished at bases.  RR 11-18.  Pt off and on on CPAP machine as needed.  At 4Lo2 on machine, and on 4L nc when off machine.  At times pt  has sats of 97 on RA.  Sats good all day 95 or >.  Occ expectorating sm amt yellow sputum.  1800 abd much improved in terms of acidosis, but cont.

Neuro:  A&O x3, calm and cooperative, freq restless in bed due to small size of bed relative to pt's habitas.  mae.  can turn in bed at home on his own, but requires # of nurses to assist c turn here.  C/o back pain when in supine position too long, as when in IR.  C/o headache, somewhat relieved c Tramadol.  

GI:  Abd obese, +BS,no c/o pain, no stool.  US showed minimal ascites.  
Pt mostly NPO today except pills.  Can have diet now but pt has nauses and wretching frequently.  Received compazine 10mg iv x2 c some relief, apparently better relief than Zofran.

GU/Renal:  U/o for day ~ 15mls, brown, sludgy urine.  Did not respond at all to Lasix 40mg in am.  Started CVVHDF at 1845 via RIJ arrow cath.  Cath has third sm lumen for our use.  Used as a KVO at 10mls/hr, but will cap off and flush.  

CVVHD at 80ml bld flow/ 1500 replacement fld, and 500 dialysate fld.  Net goal is 0 fld removal overnoc, maintain stability of patient, reassess in am for fld removal.  Initial IC back at .89, Pharmacy is preparing Calcium drip for sliding scale.  Other labs not back yet.

Endo:  Pt received no NPH this am, FS 1502-160s, covered with RISS. NPH 1/2 dose of 15 units given at 1800.

Cortisol stim study done, post level sent at 1815.

Skin:  Lower extrem discolored from venous disease.  pt had blister on RLE, covered by duoderm.  Otherwise skin intact.

Social:  Wife called twice, updated on phone, very concerned.

     HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, anemia, nasogastric tube placement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**3089-9-17**]:
     
     Nasogastric tube passes as far as the distal esophagus but the tip cannot be
     seen due to the technical limitations of imaging the  patient of this size
     with bedside equipment.  Discussed with the nurse caring for this patient the
     need to request an abdominal radiograph and the likelihood that localization
     of the NG tube would require imaging with standard equipment in the Radiology
     department.
     
     Heart remains severely enlarged.  Lung volumes have decreased since [**9-17**].
     The upper lungs are clear.  The right lung base shows some airlessness,
     consistent with atelectasis but not exclusive of pneumonia.
     
     Interval increase in caliber of the superior mediastinum attests to volume
     overload or the development of a pericardial effusion.  Clinical evaluation
     with cardiac ultrasound should be considered.  Right internal jugular catheter
     passes at least as far as the SVC but its tip is also indistinct.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2193**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5869**] and I discussed these findings at the time of dictation.

NPN 1900-0700:

EVENTS: Pt increasingly encephalopathic, unable to swallow pills. Tolerating slow fluid removal w/CRRT; system clotted once. 

ROS: 
NEURO: Pt lethargic but restless, constantly removing BiPAP mask, picking at lines, removing gown. Cooperative when asked to put mask back on, but never lasts more than 5 minutes. MAE, f/c; actually able to turn himself side to side and pull himself up in bed. Unable to swallow pills at 2000, therefore NPO the rest of the night. Has not recieved Lactulose (rectal route not feasible d/t size). 
RESP: BiPAP 20/16 w/4L bled in. Pt removing mask frequently, but usually does OK without it for awhile. Sats mostly high 90's, RR teens, very labored with any activity. ABG's actually slightly improved. Subjectively inconsistent; at times states breathing is worse, at other times states it's ""OK"". LS very diminished; strong cough productive of white sputum. 
C-V: Hemodynamically stable with good BP. Lytes WNL (Ca gtt currently off). 
GU/RENAL: Cont's on CRRT with goal fluid removal of 50cc/hr, which he is tolerating well. Minimal U/O; BUN/creat up to 80/5.4. Difficult to keep CRRT system running d/t any movement causing increase in pressures and stoppage. System did clot once and was restarted. 
GI: Large black-green stools X 3 overnight; mushroom catheter inserted once and replaced when it was found out (? if pt caught tubing on his leg while turning). Belly obese, hypoactive BS. Team unable to place NGT for meds. LFT's rising. 
HEME: Hct down slightly to 30.3 (31.2); INR and plt's stable. Stool is OB+, but no evidence of active bleed. 
ID: WBC up again to 16.0; afebrile; lactate WNL. 
SKIN: intact except duoderm on LLL. 
ACCESS: RIJ Quinton, R radial a-line, R hand PIV. 
SOCIAL: no calls or visits

A: worsening encephalopathy; hemodynamically stable

P: Pt to have swallow eval before attempting PO's again; follow MS closely; ensure pt safety; consider HD instead of CRT; monitor for evidence of bleeding; monitor for evidence of infection; continue supportive care.

Micu Nursing Progress Notes
Events: continues on CRRT, B/P 100-110/50's so fluid removal decreased to ""0"" to increase B/P to 120/ , NGT inserted for meds and lactulose increased to q4h due to decreased MS.

Cardiac:  B/P 99-120/50's, HR 80's SR with rare PAC's. Ca++ 1.23 and remains off the calcium gtt.   

Resp:  Pt received on BiPAP but pt kept removing the mask.  He was found at 8am with no O2 or BiPAP so he was placed on 4l NC with sats increasing to 97%.  When he was decreased to 3l his sats dropped to 93% so he remained on 4l.  Around 1600 he dropped his sats to 87% so he was increased to 6l and encouraged to C&DB with improvement in sats.  RR 15-24, Sats on 6l 96-97%.  His breathing is regular but he has been grunting with every breath.  When asked if he is SOB he denies it.  ABG consistant with previous ABG's. He will need to go on BiPAP for the night.

GU:  He has been on CRRT all day removing 50cc/hr.  At 1500 Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5005**] requested for ""0"" fluid removal in an attempt to increase his B/P to 120 systolic.  He is 700cc negative since MN.  He has a minimal U/O for the day-30cc since 7am.

GI:  NGT was placed with the use of hurricane spray to decrease his gag.  Placement could not be confirmed with Xray due to his habitus.  However he pulled out the tube before it could be confirmed.  A second tube was placed without difficulty and was confirmed placement by 2 MD's and this RN.  He has received his PO meds and given lactulose q4h.  Mushroom catheter in place but not draining any stool. Swallowing study placed on hold due to use of hurricane spray and decreasing mental status.

Neuro:  Pt mostly staring at nothing but when his name is called he does focus.  He has been very helpful with his turning and repositioning, he has been moving all limbs.  He has been oriented to person only, thinking it was 1946 and repeats it every time he is asked.  He was found picking at lines and was found naked several times so when he pulled out the NGT at 11am soft restraints were applied to prevent him from pulling any more tubes.

Skin:  Pt remains very jauntice but skin intact except for his lower legs.  

Social:  His wife called the patient this am and he was able to hold a conversation with her but in short sentences.  She called me later stating that he did seem confused.  She also stated that her neice was [**Name2 (NI) 666**] enduced to have her baby today so would be unable to come in until sunday.

Plan:  Continue CRRT, Pt moving to Micu B due to staffing issues, BiPAP overnight, given lactulose q4h and monitor output, maintain pt's safety with soft restraints, monitor mental status.
