Admission Date:  [**2721-11-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2721-12-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2648-11-21**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2,
hypothyroidism, and hypertension, who presented to an outside
hospital on [**2721-11-1**] with nausea, vomiting, and
malaise.  The patient was found to be in diabetic
ketoacidosis with a blood sugar of 920, pH of 6.93, and a
potassium 2.7.  She subsequently went into asystolic arrest,
and she was resuscitated with atropine, epinephrine, and
defibrillation.  There was a question of infection causing
below knee amputation, with the initial white blood cell
count increased with a left shift.  Subsequent sputum, on
[**2721-11-3**], grew MSSA.  Blood cultures, times two, grew out
coagulase negative staphylococcus, which were sterile once
the line was removed.  A-line tip grew Enterobacter,
klebsiella, and several other organisms.  She was treated
with Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl.  The below knee
amputation resolved with the usual treatment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hospital course was complicated by
difficulty in extubation.  The patient was extubated
approximately five times, two of which were self extubations.
Each time she had, what was reported in the notes from the
outside hospital, to be pulmonary edema.

She apparently had no difficulty with each of the
re-intubations, making laryngeal edema less likely.  The last
extubation lasted approximately four days.  There was
mentioned in the notes from the outside hospital of anterior
EKG changes, as well as a subtle septal/apical wall-motion
abnormality on TTE.  Given this question of pulmonary edema,
which could be secondary to recurrent ischemia or diastolic
dysfunction, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 374**] for possible cardiac
catheterization.

Other notable events included a cold ischemic foot treated
with Heparin with improvement, but a markedly decreased
platelet count.

The patient also required eight units of packed red blood
cells over the hospital stay, secondary to anemia in the
setting of Guaiac-positive stool.

Currently, upon arrival, the patient was comfortable and
intubated.  She was alert and responded to commands.  She
denies any history of cardiac disease or angina.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN, HEPARIN
with documented HIT antibody positive state.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

11. Accupril 0 mg p.o.q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a nanny.  She denies
any tobacco and any alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 144/70;
heart rate 75; breathing at 10, saturating at 98%.  The
ventilator was set at SIMV with a tidal volume of 700, rate
of 10, pressure support of 7, PEEP of 5, FIO2 OF 40%.
GENERAL:  The patient is a pleasant, elderly female, who is
intubated, alert, and mouthing words.  HEENT:  Pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Mucous membranes were dry.  NECK:  No JVD.  Right IJ
in place.  No carotid bruits.  CHEST:  Examination revealed
coarse breath sounds bilaterally, no rales or wheezes.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 normal.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Exam was soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  EXTREMITY:  Examination showed 2+
femoral without any bruits, 1+ edema in her lower extremities
bilaterally, 2+ edema in her right hand.  Pulses were
Dopplerable.  NEUROLOGICAL:  She was alert and oriented times
three, grossly nonfocal.  Line site appears clean without any
erythema, nontender.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
22.4; hematocrit 30.2; platelet count of 336; sodium 133;
potassium 3.6; chloride 97; CO2 29; BUN 29; creatinine 1.1;
glucose 213.  She had a CK of 8, troponin of less than .3.
She had an EKG, which was in normal sinus rhythm, normal
axis, normal interval, no T-wave inversions, good R wave
progression.

Chest x-ray from [**2721-11-26**] revealed patchy and linear
bibasilar opacities, most likely secondary to atelectasis.
No pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU
for evaluation of possible cardiac ischemic contributing to
pulmonary edema.  The patient was hemodynamically stable upon
her arrival.  She was rapidly converted to pressor-support
ventilation and required minimal assistance with her
respirations.

On the morning after admission, the patient continued to be
stable on the ventilator with minimal assistance.  The
decision was made to extubate her in the presence of both the
ENT Service, as well as Anesthesia Service.  The patient
underwent direct laryngoscopy by the ENT Service and no
evidence of supraglottic edema was noted.  The patient was
determined to be ready to be extubated from both a
respiratory and ENT standpoint.  She was extubated without
any difficulty, maintaining oxygen saturation of 98% to 99%
on three liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.

Throughout the remainder of her hospital stay, the patient
remained stable from a respiratory standpoint.  She
maintained good oxygenation.  She was noted to be breathing
comfortably on minimal oxygen supplementation.

The next question, which we attempted to address was the
following:  Whether there was a significant contribution of
ischemia.  We reviewed the films from the outside hospital
and did not note any significant pulmonary edema on any of
the films.  We found no evidence of ischemic EKG changes on
her electrocardiogram, nor did we see any significant
pulmonary edema on her chest films done here.  The patient
was continued on aspirin, Lopressor, Accupril, and Zocor.
She remained asymptomatic without any chest discomfort or
shortness of breath.  Ultimately, the team decided to send
the patient for a Persantine, may be stress test, rather than
the more invasive cardiac catheterization.  As of this
dictation, the results of the P-Sestimibi are pending, but
will be added as an addendum.

Another issue, which arose during the patient's
hospitalization was a persistent nausea.  Apparently, this
has been a longstanding problem for over a month.  We think
that the most likely etiology is diabetic gastroparesis.  We
have started the patient on QAC and QHS Reglan, as well as
Zofran for symptomatic relief of the nausea.  The patient
will have outpatient GI followup for both the nausea, as well
as the history of anemia and Guaiac-positive stools at the
outside hospital.

The patient was seen by the Physical Therapy Department.  It
was decided that the [**Hospital 874**] rehabilitation would be
beneficial to the patient given her longstanding hospital
stay with subsequent deconditioning.  The patient will thus
be discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility for
physical reconditioning.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      73 year old woman with DM who was trasferred from an OSH for 5 failed
      extubations attributed to pulmonary edema
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate bibasilar retrocardiac densities noted on portable; r/o interstitial
      edema
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  73 y/o woman with diabetes, transferred from outside hospital for
     failed extubation; pulmonary edema.  Evaluate bibasilar retrocardiac densities
     noted on portable.  Rule out interstitial edema.
     
     CHEST, 2 VIEWS:  Comparison is made to a prior study of [**2721-11-27**].  The heart
     is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
     pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is persistent opacification of the
     right lower lobe in the retrocardiac region.  This area is obscured by the
     wheelchair on the lateral film.  The opacities in the left lower lobe are
     somewhat decreased.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  The
     diaphragms are flattened due to emphysema.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Persistent parenchymal opacity in the right lower lobe and
     improving opacity in the left lower lobe.  While these might be due to
     atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
     
     2)  Small bilateral pleural effusion.
     
     3)  Emphysema.  No evidence of CHF.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a  dose of 
     approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.  There were no symptoms or ST segment changes.
      
     HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, pulmonary edema.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion, 
     MIBI was administered IV.
      
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
      
     Stress and resting perfusion images show no myocardial perfusion defects.
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after 
     Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater
     than 70%.  There is normal wall motion.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Normal study. /nkg

     GASTRIC EMPTYING STUDY                                          Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 3980**]
     Reason: LONG STANDING DIABETES, NAUSEA AND REFLUX SYMPTOMS. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     yHISTORY:  Diabetes, nausea and reflux symptoms.
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
      
     Following the oral ingestion of a meal of radiolabeled egg- whites, the patient
     was placed supine beneath the gamma camera. Multiple anterior and posterior 
     images of the tracer activity in the stomach and bowel were recorded for 60
     minutes. 
      
     Visual analysis of tracer activity in the stomach shows a normal gastric
     emptying pattern.  An accurate numeric measurement of gastric emptying is
     difficult to obtain since the gastric antrum is obscured by overlying small
     bowel activity.  
      
     IMPRESSION:  Normal gastric emptying study. /nkg
