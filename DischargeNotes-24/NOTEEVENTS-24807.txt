     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      40 year old woman with resp distress and hx  aspiration pneumonia
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION: Respiratory distress, history of aspiration pneumonia.
     
     SINGLE VIEW CHEST:
     
     This study is limited as the patient is severely rotated.  There is evidence
     for prior cervical fixation.  The left shoulder is not visualized on this
     single radiograph.
     
     The heart and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to technical
     limitations.  However, there is increased opacity overlying the right lower
     lung zone, with air bronchograms.  There also appears to be increased
     retrocardiac opacity, with air bronchograms.  The lungs are otherwise clear.
     No definite evidence for pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION: Airspace consolidation in both lower lung zones. In the
     appropriate clinical context, this may be consistent with aspiration
     pneumonia.

Admission Date:  [**3033-4-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**3033-4-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2992-11-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:

ADDENDUM:  This addendum is covering dates [**4-20**], through
[**4-23**].

CONTINUATION OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Pulmonary:  On [**4-20**], the patient acutely desaturated to
81% on her baseline six liter oxygen by nasal cannula.
Respiratory Therapy was called for chest Physical Therapy and
suctioning.  Approximately 10 cc of brown thick secretions
were suctioned with relief of the patient's respiratory
status.  Her breathing became more comfortable and her oxygen
saturation improved to 98% on five liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula.  The patient  had a chest x-ray done at the time
which was stable and an arterial blood gas which showed
decrease pO2 with stable compensated elevation in bicarbonate
and pCO2, thought to be secondary to the patient's baseline
neuromuscular compromise.

The patient had one more episode of decreased oxygenation on
the night of [**4-20**].  This time, solid food was actually
suctioned from the patient.  The patient was then improved
similar to the prior episode.  The patient was advised that a
G-tube or tracheostomy would benefit her and that we expected
that she would continue to aspirate as she has in the past.
However, the patient is adamant that she does not need and
does not want any G-tube and refused to discuss the matter
further.  As the patient is followed primarily at the
[**Hospital 408**] Hospital we will leave further discussions of this
matter to her primary care providers there.  Of note, the
patient has had a swallowing evaluation at the [**Hospital 408**]
Hospital so, therefore, this will not be pursued further at
this time.

2.  Infectious Disease:  The patient is being treated for
pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia, with Vancomycin
to cover Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her
sputum as well as Levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration
pneumonia.  These antibiotics will continue until [**3033-4-30**].

3.  Wound Care:  The patient will have an outpatient
evaluation by Plastic Surgery as follow-up to the wound care
and nursing evaluation received while in-house.  The Plastic
Surgery Clinic is at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2506**].  Alternatively, the
patient can follow-up through the [**Hospital 408**] Hospital which is
probably preferable because she has routine care at the
[**Hospital 408**] Hospital.  The Plastic Surgery Service recommended
that the patient follow-up in one to two weeks after
discharge, approximately mid-[**Female First Name (un) 1137**].

4.  Pain Control:  The patient will continue on her pain
medications as discussed in the previous discharge summary.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient is continuing on her Prednisone
taper with a goal of 5 mg p.o. per day of Prednisone which is
her baseline for adrenal insufficiency.  The patient will be
at this goal starting the [**5-25**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Scopolamine patch every 72 hours.

16. Reglan 10 mg p.o. four times a day.
17. Neurontin 900 mg p.o. three times a day.
18. Baclofen 30 mg p.o. q. six hours.
19. Magnesium citrate one bottle p.o. q. day p.r.n.
20. Morphine sulfate, immediate release, 5 to 10 mg p.o. q.
four to six hours p.r.n.
21. Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. twice a day.
22. Flagyl 500 mg intravenously three times a day to stop
[**3033-4-30**].
23. Levofloxacin 500 mg intravenous q. day to stop [**4-30**].
24. Vancomycin one gram intravenously q. 12 hours, stop [**4-30**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Wound care:  Sacral wound should be dressed with wet to
moist dressing changes each day.
2.  She will require follow-up with Plastic Surgery either
here at [**Hospital1 4**], Clinic number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2506**], the second week of [**Female First Name (un) 1137**], or through [**Hospital 408**]
Hospital where she receives her regular care.
3.  Duoderm should be placed on her heel ulcers.
4.  Follow-up will be with her primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **], at [**Hospital 408**] Hospital.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital3 6085**] where she permanently lives.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Improved.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Aspiration pneumonia with requirement for long-term IV
     antibiotics. The IV team was unable to place PICC line at the bedside.
     
     OPERATORS: [**Last Name (LF) 3025**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 812**]. Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5892**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 812**], the attending radiologist,
     was present and supervised the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: Written and signed informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     The left upper arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion after the patient
     was laid supine on the fluoroscopy table. [**Doctor Last Name **] scale ultrasound was used to
     identify a freely compressible left basilic vein, and the overlying tissues
     were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. Ultrasound was needed since so suitable
     superficial veins were visible. A single wall ministick needle was then guided
     under ultrasound into this vessel, with return of dark, nonpulsatile blood. A
     .018 wire was passed through the needle lumen and guided under fluoroscopic
     visualization to the mid SVC. The needle was replaced over the wire with the
     ministick sheath, and the distance to the SVC was measured along the wire. A 4
     Fr Vaxcel single lumen PICC was cut to 39 cm and threaded under fluoroscopic
     guidance centrally. The last few centimeters of the catheter were inserted
     with concurrent pealing away of the sheath, the wire was removed, and a
     confirmatory static image was obtained. The procedural site was cleaned off
     and the external portion of the PICC fixated with a StatLock. The patient
     tolerated the procedure satisfactorily. There were no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Technically successful placement of a 4 Fr single lumen Vaxcel
     PICC via the left basilic vein to the level of the mid SVC. The PICC is ready
     for use. The final chest-X-ray is rotated and there is possiblilty of left
     lower lobe volume loss. A chest X-Ray in more upright position was therefore
     recommended verbally to the referring resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6266**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6267**].

     HISTORY:  Respiratory distress and a history of aspiration pneumonia.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to an exam of [**3033-4-20**].  The cardiac
     silhouette and mediastinal/hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is a
     persistent collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe with obscuration of
     the left hemidiaphragm and probable parapneumonic effusion. There is an
     improved right basilar infiltrate. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal
     limits. The soft tissues and osseous structures are stable.  There has been
     interval placement of a left-sided central venous catheter with the tip
     overlying the region of the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar consolidation, left side greater than right, with a
     probable left pleural effusion.  These findings are consistent with aspiration
     pneumonia. Followup radiographs are suggested to document complete
     resolution.

     seen, consistent with pneumonia. There is a small left sided pleural effusion.
     Improved visualization of the left hemidiaphragm could represent improvement
     of pneumonia or shift of pleural effusion due to increased rotation. Metal
     plate and screws from anterior fixation of C spine is better seen on the prior
     study. Soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Persistent left lower lobe pneumonia and small left sided pleural

     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The right upper arm was prepped in a sterile fashion.
     Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for
     localization of a suitable vein. The cephalic vein was patent and
     compressible. After local anesthesia with 2 ml 1% Lidocaine, the cephalic vein
     was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. An 0.018
     guide wire was advanced under fluoroscopy. 20 cc of Optiray was administered
     intravenously to demonstrate the venous flow and anatomy within the right
     upper extremity. The veins are somewhat narrowed. However, an 0.018 guide wire
     was able to be advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava. Based
     on the marks on the guide wire it was determined that a length of 48 cm would
     be suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 FR
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The
     sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed. A final chest X-ray was
     obtained. The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava just
     above the atrium. The line is ready for use. A stat lock was applied and the

     with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**] (attending radiologist) being present and supervising.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: The left upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion. As no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was
     used for localization. The basilic vein was patent and compressible. After
     local anesthesia with 2 ml of 1% Lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under
     ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. A 0.018 guidewire was
     advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava. Based on markers it
     was determined that a length of 49 cm would be suitable. The PICC line was
     trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 French introducer sheath under
     fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The sheath was removed and
     the catheter was flushed. A final chest x-ray was taken and demonstrated the
     tip to be at the SVC/right atrial junction. The line is ready for use. A
     statlock was applied and the line was hep-locked.

     INDICATIONS: Aspiration pneumonia.
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from  one day earlier.
     
     There is increased opacity in the right lower hemithorax with associated
     displacement of both the major and minor fissures.  The right hemidiaphragm is
     partially obscured and the right heart border is also partially obscured. The
     left cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. There
     remains an area of dense opacity with air bronchograms at the left base. A
     small left pleural effusion is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar consolidation as demonstrated previously, consistent
     with aspiration pneumonia. However, the opacification on the right side is now
     accompanied by volume loss, suggesting a component of collapse within the
     right middle and right lower lobes. This may be due to mucus plugging.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     TWO VIEWS OF THE THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE:
     
     INDICATION:  40 year old female with quadriplegia and back pain.  Evaluate for
     osteomyelitis or other cause for back pain.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are no studies available for comparison.  There is evidence
     of prior cervical spine surgery with anterior plating and screws within the
     lower cervical spine.  There is evidence of old traumatic injury within the
     pelvis with a healed fracture within the left iliac bone and diastasis of the
     symphysis pubis which appears chronic in nature.  There is cervicothoracic
     scoliosis with convexity to the left.  There is anterior wedging of a
     vertebral body within the upper thoracic spine of indeterminate age.
     Comparison films would be helpful in better evaluating this abnormality. There
     is normal alignment of the thoracic spine on the lateral view.  There are no
     areas of suspicious bone destruction. There is diffuse demineralization. There
     is a hiatal hernia in the retrocardiac region.
     
     Within the lumbar spine, the vertebral bodies are normal in height and
     alignment. The intervertebral disc spaces are preserved.  There are no
     suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the lumbar spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No suspicious areas of permeative bone destruction.  If clinical suspicion
     of osteomyelitis remains high, a bone scan can be performed for further
     assessment of possible osteomyelitis.
     2)  Anterior wedging of an upper thoracic vertebral body.  This finding is of
     indeterminate age and comparison films would be helpful to assess the age of
     this anterior compression.
     3)  Old traumatic injury within the pelvis and old post surgical changes
     within the cervical spine as described above.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  H/o sacral decubitus ulcers as well as left back ulcer with severe  
     back pain.  ? osteomyelitis.
      
     PHYSICAL EXAM:  Dressings are overlying the left posterior chest as well as left
     sacrum.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Anterior and posterior flows as well as tissue phase images of
     the abdomen and pelvis were obtained.  Additionally, delayed phase whole body
     images are obtained.
      
     In the tissue phase, there is abnormally increased tracer uptake in the
     posterior left hip/sacral area.  Uptake in these regions is intensified in the
     delayed phase images.  In addition, there is an area of mildly increased uptake
     along the posterolateral aspect of the approximately T8 left rib.
      
     The kidneys are well visualized, and there is tracer noted in the Foley
     catheter. These are the normal route of tracer excretion.
      
     IMPRESSION:   1) Osteomyelitis involving the left pelvis, at the location of the
     sacral ulcer. 2) Increased tracer uptake along the left approximately 8th rib,
     corresponding to the location of a dressing overlying the chest wall.  While the
     intensity is lower than what is normally seen, this ulcer likely represents a
     focus of osteomyelitis.  3) There findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 103**], at
     the time of interpretation. /nkg

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY: Paraplegia, aspiration pneumonia, increased sedation.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the brain were obtained without IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS: Prior study [**3033-7-9**].
     
     FINDINGS: Posterior fossa images are degraded by streak artifacts.  Within
     these limitations, there is no shift of normal midline structures or mass
     effect. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are normal. The grey- white matter
     differentiation is normal.  There are no pathologic extra-axial fluid
     collections.  The paranasal sinuses are clear. There are no skull fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
     
     COMMENT:  The lateral scout radiograph discloses partial imaging of metallic
     internal fixation devices in the midcervical spine, as in the setting of an
     anterior cervical fusion.

     recurrent aspiration pneumonia, now with increased sedation and
     unresponsiveness.
     
     Portable AP chest dated [**3033-9-10**] is compared to the prior image dated
     [**3033-9-2**].
     
     FINDINGS: This study is limited secondary to patient positioning. In the
     interval, the right IJ catheter and endotracheal tube have been removed. There
     is a left PICC catheter in stable position. The cardiac and mediastinal
     contours appear stable. There is a persistent right lower lobe
     infiltrate/atelectasis which appears somewhat improved in the interval. In
     addition, there is a left lower lobe collapse/consolidation. There are no
     pleural effusions. The visualized osseous structures and soft tissues are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Persistent bibasilar opacities which could represent atelectasis
     versus aspiration pneumonia in this patient.
