     HISTORY: Metastatic melanoma. Cough and fevers.
     
     CHEST, 2 VIEWS: There are no prior chest xrays available for comparison. There
     is a pleural based mass in the left upper thorax posteriorly. There are
     pulmonary nodules in the lungs, most obvious in the left upper lobe, with
     more subtle small nodular densities in the right lung. There is patchy density
     in the left lower lobe with obliteration of the diaphragm. There is a left
     pleural effusion. There is no right effusion. There are prominent interstitial
     markings throughout the lungs. There is prominent soft tissue density in the
     region of both hila.
     
     IMPRESSION: Parenchymal and pleural base masses, consistent with metastases.
     Left lower lobe consolidation with effusion. Underlying mass in this region
     cannot be excluded. Prominent interstitial markings, which could represent
     lymphangetic carcinomatosis. Prominent nodular opacities in the region of the
     hila, possibly representing adenopathy. If warranted, CT scan could be
     performed for further evaluation.

     HISTORY: 47-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, now with visual
     disturbance and headache.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the brain were obtained after the administration of
     100 cc of intravenous Conray.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3011-5-9**].
     
     CT HEAD WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen is linear tubular enhancement within the
     right inferior frontal lobe extending to the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 79**] ependymal
     surface, a finding which is unchanged from prior exam  and probably represents
     a developmental venous anomaly. There is no surrounding mass effect, midline
     shift, or edema. The CSF spaces are stable, normal for this patient's age.
     There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. No pathologic
     enhancement to suggest metastatic disease.
     
     The low attenuation previously noted on the left frontal aspect of the
     calvarium is not apparent on the current study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No evidence for metastatic disease.
     
     2. Probable developmental venous anomaly involving the right inferior frontal
     lobe.

Date of Birth:   [**2964-1-25**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine, [**Doctor Last Name 2451**] Firm
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
woman who, in [**3003**], had an 81.14-mm thick melanoma found on
her right posterior thigh.  In [**3009-3-23**], the patient had
a right inguinal area lymph node resected with positive
margins.  Between [**3009-4-22**] and [**3009-6-22**], the patient
from [**3009-4-22**] to [**3010-4-23**].  In [**3009-8-23**], a CT
of the chest showed a right upper lobe nodule.  In [**3010-8-24**], two more right upper lobe nodules were found.  In
[**3010-12-24**] a CT of the chest revealed left lower lobe
nodule, and in [**3011-3-24**] a CT revealed pancreatic lesions
times two, as well as new lesions in the left lower lobe and
right upper lobe.  Also noted was a subcutaneous mass in the
patient underwent COG and a 36958 trial beginning on [**3011-5-27**].  On [**3011-7-8**], the patient reported cough and fever
and was started on Zithromax but continued to have a dry
cough and dyspnea on exertion.

One day prior to admission, the patient had fever to 100.
Her oxygen saturation was apparently checked at home and
found to be 91% on room air.  The patient was sent to the
Emergency Department for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Melanoma metastatic to lungs, pleura,
pancreas, axilla.  In [**3003**], status post resection of melanoma
from right posterior thigh.  In [**3009-3-23**], status post
right inguinal lymph node resection with positive margins.
Radiation therapy from [**3009-4-22**] through [**3009-6-22**].  In
[**3009-4-22**] through [**3010-4-23**], the patient received
interferon.  In [**3009-8-23**], right upper lobe lung
nodules were found.  In [**3010-12-24**] new nodules were
found in the left lower lobe.  In [**3011-3-24**] pancreatic
lesions were found.  In [**3011-4-23**] subcutaneous axillary
nodules were found.  The patient experienced femoral
neuropathy secondary to radiation therapy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  MSIR 24 st q.d., MS Contin p.o.
b.i.d. (the patient did not know dose).  In the Emergency
Department the patient received Levaquin 500 mg intravenously
times one, as well as Flagyl 500 mg intravenously times one,
and morphine 2 mg intravenously times two, and 4 mg
intravenously times two.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and smoked one to two
packs of cigarettes per day times 30 years; she quit in
[**3010-12-24**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died at the age of 67
of leukemia.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Complete blood count was
notable for a white blood cell count of 14.8, hematocrit
of 34, and platelets 636.  The patient's Chem-7 revealed a
sodium of 133, potassium of 4, chloride of 96, bicarbonate
of 18, BUN of 15, creatinine of 0.5, glucose of 112.  Anion
gap of 19.  Creatine kinase was 34, and troponin was 0.3.
INR was 1.3, PTT was 27.8, PT was 13.9.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  In general, the patient
was a cachectic ill-appearing female with moderate
respiratory distress.  Vital signs were as follows:
Temperature 97.6, heart rate 113, blood pressure 98/66,
breathing 20 times per minute.  HEENT revealed pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Oropharynx with dry
mucous membranes.  Neck revealed no jugular venous
distention.  Chest examination revealed pulmonary crackles at
the right anterior upper field as well as decreased breath
sounds and tubular sounds in the left side.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed tachycardia with no murmurs heard.
Heart sounds were clear.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds, positive subcutaneous
nodule in the right upper quadrant.  Extremities were without
edema.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Other studies on admission included chest
CT from [**7-24**] revealed extensive lymphadenopathy in the
right axilla, especially in the superior region.  There was a
right hilar, and pretracheal, and precarinal lymphadenopathy;
left-sided pleural effusion approximately halfway up the
field; slight right shift of the mediastinum; right upper
lobe pneumonia; right pleural based nodules; left lower lobe
complete collapse.

Chest x-ray on [**7-24**] revealed a new left-sided effusion as
noted above, right high-powered border with questionable
border.

Electrocardiogram of [**3011-7-24**], revealed sinus
tachycardia with a heart rate of 133, right bundle-branch
block pattern with loss of R waves anteriorly, low voltages.
Compared with [**3011-4-23**], the right bundle-branch block was
new, and the voltages were significantly lower.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the O-MED
Service on [**3011-7-24**], due to her dyspnea and elevated
temperatures at home.  As noted above, CT and chest x-ray
revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, as well as a large
left-sided pleural effusion, and right upper lobe pneumonia.
The patient was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl, and
underwent 2-liter thoracentesis.  Electrocardiogram showed
low voltage.  Echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion
with sustained right atrium and diastolic right ventricular
collapse.

Thus, the patient underwent a 350-cc pericardiocentesis and
was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit with a pigtail
drain.  The drain was discontinued on [**3011-7-27**], without
any complications.  The patient's condition continued to wane
despite her antibiotics and pleurocentesis and
pericardiocentesis.

The patient's husband did not want the patient to have home
hospice secondary to concerns about the patient and her
husband's children being at home.  The husband, thus,
preferred inpatient hospice.  The patient and the patient's
family changed the patient's status to DNR/DNI on [**3011-7-26**], and she was made comfort measures only.  All
medications and monitoring were discontinued except for
morphine and Ativan.  The patient was transferred to the
medical floor on [**3011-7-29**].

On the morning of [**3011-7-30**], the cross-covering house
officer was called to evaluate the patient for lack of
spontaneous respirations.  The house officer found the
patient to be without spontaneous respirations, and without
spontaneous heart beats, as well as to have fixed and dilated
pupils bilaterally.  The patient was thus pronounced dead on
the morning of [**3011-7-30**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Widely metastatic melanoma.
2.  Status post radiation therapy.
3.  Status post chemotherapy.
4.  Pneumonia.












CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient, as noted above, was
pronounced dead on the morning of [**3011-7-30**].

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      47 year old woman with met. melanoma, known lung mets, presents with tachypnea,
      hypoxia.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      To evaluate for progression of metastatic disease in patient with melanoma,
      rapid onset of respiratory distress and new RUL infiltrate/mass, new large left
      pleural effusion, with no established code status.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT CHEST [**3011-7-25**].
     
     INDICATION:  47 year old woman with metastatic melanoma presenting with
     tachypnea and hypoxia.  Please evaluate for progression of metastatic disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical imaging was obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the upper abdomen after administration of IV contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  110 cc of Optiray contrast used secondary to respiratory distress.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  [**3011-7-4**].
     
     CT SCAN OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Soft tissue windows demonstrate extensive
     right axillary lymphadenopathy that has increased in the interval.  Also again
     identified is extensive superior mediastinal, right hilar, pretracheal and
     subcarinal lymphadenopathy.  This is all slightly increased when compared to
     previous exam.  Also increased in the interval is the left-sided pleural
     effusion which was previously small and is now marked and fills approximately
     [**12-25**] of the left hemithorax.  There is a slight rightward shift of the
     mediastinal structures.  Also new in the interval is a small right-sided
     pleural effusion.  Again metastatic pleural disease is identified within the
     left pleural space.  There is also metastatic pleural disease within the right
     pleural space on the current exam.
     
     The lung windows demonstrate a right upper lobe alveolar opacity with air
     bronchograms compatible with pneumonia.  There is complete collapse of the
     left lower lobe associated with this pleural effusion.  There is some passive
     atelectasis associated with the right lower lobe pleural effusion.  Multiple
     pulmonary nodules are seen throughout all aerated lung compatible with
     metastatic disease.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Extensive metastatic disease that has slightly progressed in the interval
     as discussed above.
     2.  Right upper lobe pneumonia.
     3.  Increasing large left-sided pleural effusion which now occupies over half
     the left thoracic cavity.  Again pleural metastatic disease is seen within
     this pleural effusion.  There is associated complete collapse of the left
     lower lobe.  There is a small right-sided pleural effusion with associated
                                                                 (Over)

     CHEST, SINGLE VIEW  [**3011-7-25**]
     
     Comparison study dated [**3011-6-26**], CT exam dated [**3011-7-25**].
     
     The heart is not grossly enlarged, however when compared with prior study from
     [**3011-6-26**] appears somewhat increased in size. This is consistent with patient's
     known history of pericardial effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
     otherwise unremarkable. There has been interval drainage of a left sided
     pleural effusion.  There is now a infiltrate apparent in the left lower lung
     field which could represent pneumonia or re-expansion pulmonary edema. The
     right upper lobe infiltarte noted on prior exam [**7-24**] appears somewhat decreased
     in intensity. Again noted are multiple pulmonary nodules. There is no
     pneumothorax. Soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Resolution of left sided effusion.
     2.  Left lower lung field infiltrate.
     3.  Slight decrease in right upper lung infiltrate.
     4.  Multiple pulmonary nodules.

     COMPARISON: [**3011-7-25**].
     
     PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST @ 7:40: There has been interval placement of a
     drain the tip of which overlies the cardiac silhouette. The right upper lobe
     air space opacity is perhaps slightly increased since the previous
     examination. There is diffuse increased opacity over the left hemithorax which
     is also new since the previous exam and could reflect air space consolidation
     vs. re-expansion of pulmonary edema. There is probably some remaining pleural
     fluid on the left. No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION: Persistent right upper lobe pneumonia. New increased opacity over
     the left hemithorax which may represent re-expansion of pulmonary edema vs.
     developing infectious process.
