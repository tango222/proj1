                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with trauma and left-sided weakness.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal, and T2 and gradient echo
     axial images of the cervical spine were acquired.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is evidence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis with
     large anterior osteophytes.  There is fracture subluxation seen at C5-C6 level
     with widening of the disc space anteriorly and jumped facet on the left side
     as seen on the previous CT.  High-grade spinal stenosis is seen at the C5-C6
     level secondary to buckling of the posterior ligament and increased signal is
     seen within the spinal cord at this level.  Additionally, there is evidence of
     subdural hematoma identified posteriorly to the spinal cord with compression
     of the cord extending from C5-C6 inferiorly.  The inferior extent of the
     hematoma is not visualized.  Prevertebral soft tissue swelling is visualized
     on the sagittal images.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the
     cervical and upper thoracic region.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Fracture subluxation at C5-C6 level with jumped facet on the left
     side.  Subdural hematoma posterior to the cord with compression of the cord
     from C5-6 inferiorly . Increased signal within the spinal cord indicating cord
     edema at C4 and C5 level. Findings were conveyed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1036**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1037**] at
     the time of interpretation of this study on [**2898-5-10**] at 9:00 p.m.

     INDICATION:  84-year-old man status post fall.  Please evaluate for fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast helical scanning of the cervical spine was
     performed without IV contrast.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were
     obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient has diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis or DISH
     involving the anterior cervical spine and visualized thoracic spine.
     
     At C5- C6, there is a fracture of this anterior anterior longitudinal ligament
     ossificiation.  Additionally, there is anterior subluxation of C5 on C6 with a
     locked left facet joint causing a moderate degree of rotary subluxation as
     well.  There are freactures of the superior and inferior facets at this
     level on the right. On both the axial and sagittal images, there appears to be
     a disruption of the spinal canal; however, please note that CT is not able to
     provide any intrathecal detail. At C5-C6, the intervertebral disc space is
     widened.  The remaining visualized disc spaces are uniformly narrowed.  No
     paraspinal abnormalities are identified.  Again noted is diffuse idiopathic
     skeletal hyperostosis of the visualized thoracic spine.  Scattered arterial
     calcifications are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Fracture subluxation complex at C5-C6 with locked unilateral left
     facet at this level.  If abnormality or injury to the spinal cord is
     suspected, an MRI should be considered.  At the conclusion of this
     examination, these findings were discussed with the neuro attending, Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 1032**] [**Name (STitle) 1033**].
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is right lateral subluxation of the
     superior cervical spine at the fracture level.
     
     There is extensive intraspinal hemorrhage, probably epidural. This is most
     severe at C5-6, where there is leftward displacement of the cord with cord
     compression. There is also a fracture of the ossified ALL at C6-7 with
     widening of the anterior disk space.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     INDICATION:  84-year-old man with left-sided weakness.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Noncontrast head CT [**2897-7-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence for intra-axial or extra-axial fluid
     collections, including hemorrhage.  Again, there is no shift of normally
     midline structures or mass effect identified.  There is likely age-related
     brain atrophy and related ventricular enlargement, but no hydrocephalus. There
     is diffuse periventricular low attenuation suggesting chronic small vessel
     ischemia.  Additionally, there is an essentially unchanged area of subcortical
     white matter hypodensity within the right frontoparietal region. Again, noted
     are small punctate hypodensity suggestive of small lacunar infarctions within
     the thalami, and a new low density focus within the periventricular white
     matter adjacent to the right lateral ventricle, seen best on series 2, image
     15.  The surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable.  The visualized
     paranasal sinuses are clear. 
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence for bleed.
     2)  Chronic small vessel ischemic changes within the periventricular white
     matter.
     3)  Punctate hypodensities likely representing lacunar infarcts, which do not
     appear acute in nature.
     4)  Unchanged hypodensity within the right frontoparietal region, suggestive
     of old infarction.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Fall.  Abdominal distention and lactic acidosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the torso were acquired following administration of
     oral and 150 cc of Optiray IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  Torso CT scan from [**5-7**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Extensive aortic calcifications are
     present.  They are located along the inferior surface of the aortic arch,
     projecting slightly to the left is a focal 10 x 8 x 6 mm pseudoaneurysm.  The
     pseudoaneurysm is not surrounded by hematoma, and a fat planes around the
     aorta from the remaining mediastinal structures.  Located in the posterior
     mediastinum on the right, just above the azygos arch is an ovoid high
     attenuation collection, which does not demonstrate significant enhancement,
     but was not present on the prior study, and likely represents blood products.
     An NG tube is present.  There is no pneumomediastinum within the thorax.
     Several bubbles of air are seen along the left side of the neck just above the
     left clavicular head.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is present with the tip in the
     intralobar pulmonary artery on the right.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  There
     is no pericardial effusion.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
     which demonstrate low Hounsfield units consistent with simple fluid.
     Evaluation of lung windows shows dense areas of consolidation in both lower
     lobes.  There is no pneumothorax.  A tiny 3 mm nodule is seen within the left
     upper lobe, and a 5 mm nodule is seen in the right middle lobe.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver and spleen are intact.  The
     gallbladder, adrenal glands, stomach, and small bowel are unremarkable.  Both
     kidneys enhance symmetrically and demonstrate multiple bilateral likely renal
     cysts, many of which are too small to fully characterize.  No pathologically
     enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.
     
     Evaluation of the colon shows opacification of the entire cecum and ascending
     colon with oral contrast.  The transverse colon and descending colon are
     relatively collapsed and not filled with contrast.  Located in the hepatic
     flexure is a suggestion of a soft tissue mass.  The colon is decompressed
     distal to this soft tissue mass.  There is wall thickening in the ascending
     colon proximal to the lesion.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  The
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     bladder contains a Foley catheter and air.  Air and stool are present within
     the sigmoid colon and rectum.  No enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.
     There is a fat containing inguinal hernias bilaterally.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Degenerative changes are seen within the spine.  No acute
     fractures are visualized.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were helpful in
     assessing the aortic pseudoaneurysm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Focal 10 mm aortic pseudoaneurysm along the inferior/left lateral
     undersurface of the aortic arch. The pseudoaneurysm was likely present on
     [**2897-4-30**] study, and is not surrounded by hematoma suggesting that this is a
     chronic finding.
     2.  Nonenhancing high attenuation material to the right of the esophagus and
     the posterior mediastinum.  This is new from the prior study, and likely
     represents a focal area of hemorrhage.  As it is intimately opposed to be
     esophagus, esophageal injury is also on the differential diagnosis, but there
     is no evidence of adjacent air. This could be further evaluated with
     fluoroscopic evaluation of the esophagus. Several air bubbles are seen in the
     anterior left neck just above the left clavicular head.  This could be due to
     prior attempted intravenous access.  It would be atypical for the hematoma to
     be originating from the aortic pseudoaneurysm as a fat plane is seen around
     the aorta.
     3.  Findings are worrisome for colonic adenocarcinoma in the hepatic flexure.
     Further evaluation with colonoscopy or CT colonography is recommended.  No
     focal liver lesions.
     4.  No evidence of acute traumatic intra-abdominal injury.
     5.  Multiple likely bilateral renal cysts.
     
     Results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1042**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1043**], the surgical resident caring
     for the patient, at 7:10 p.m. on [**2898-5-11**].

     Essentially, since the previous exam, there has been no significant change. 
     Again, noted are extensive chronic small vessel infarcts with subcortical
     frontoparietal hypodensity, which are consistent with old infarcts. 
     Additionally, there is area of hypodensity within the right cerebellar
     hemisphere, which is consistent with old infarcts.  There are multiple lacunes
     within bilateral basal ganglia, unchanged.  No intracranial hemorrhage is
     visualized.  There are small areas of soft tissue changes within the left
     parietal scalp, which is likely secondary to patient's recent trauma.  This
     area also appears unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage.  No significant change as compared to
     the previous exam.

     INDICATION:  84-year-old male status post trauma.  Evaluate for fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the thoracic spine were obtained with
     coronal and sagittal reconstruction.  There are no prior studies for
     comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is multilevel disc degenerative disease throughout the
     thoracic spine with an anterior bridging osteophyte, but no evidence of
     fracture or cord compression at any level is seen.  The patient appears to be
     intubated.  An NG tube also appears to be in place.  There is dense
     opacification of the right lower lobe and to a lesser degree of the left lower
     lobe, which could represent area of atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Clinical
     correlation recommended.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multilevel disc degenerative disease and a bridging osteophyte
     anteriorly but no evidence of spinal fracture.

     INDICATIONS:  Fall.  Abdominal distention and lactic acidosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the torso were acquired following administration of
     oral and 150 cc of Optiray IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  Torso CT scan from [**5-7**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Extensive aortic calcifications are
     present.  They are located along the inferior surface of the aortic arch,
     projecting slightly to the left is a focal 10 x 8 x 6 mm pseudoaneurysm.  The
     pseudoaneurysm is not surrounded by hematoma, and a fat planes around the
     aorta from the remaining mediastinal structures.  Located in the posterior
     mediastinum on the right, just above the azygos arch is an ovoid high
     attenuation collection, which does not demonstrate significant enhancement,
     but was not present on the prior study, and likely represents blood products.
     An NG tube is present.  There is no pneumomediastinum within the thorax.
     Several bubbles of air are seen along the left side of the neck just above the
     left clavicular head.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is present with the tip in the
     intralobar pulmonary artery on the right.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  There
     is no pericardial effusion.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
     which demonstrate low Hounsfield units consistent with simple fluid.
     Evaluation of lung windows shows dense areas of consolidation in both lower
     lobes.  There is no pneumothorax.  A tiny 3 mm nodule is seen within the left
     upper lobe, and a 5 mm nodule is seen in the right middle lobe.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver and spleen are intact.  The
     gallbladder, adrenal glands, stomach, and small bowel are unremarkable.  Both
     kidneys enhance symmetrically and demonstrate multiple bilateral likely renal
     cysts, many of which are too small to fully characterize.  No pathologically
     enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.
     
     Evaluation of the colon shows opacification of the entire cecum and ascending
     colon with oral contrast.  The transverse colon and descending colon are
     relatively collapsed and not filled with contrast.  Located in the hepatic
     flexure is a suggestion of a soft tissue mass.  The colon is decompressed
     distal to this soft tissue mass.  There is wall thickening in the ascending
     colon proximal to the lesion.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  The
                                                                 (Over)

     bladder contains a Foley catheter and air.  Air and stool are present within
     the sigmoid colon and rectum.  No enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.
     There is a fat containing inguinal hernias bilaterally.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Degenerative changes are seen within the spine.  No acute
     fractures are visualized.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were helpful in
     assessing the aortic pseudoaneurysm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Focal 10 mm aortic pseudoaneurysm along the inferior/left lateral
     undersurface of the aortic arch. The pseudoaneurysm was likely present on
     [**2897-4-30**] study, and is not surrounded by hematoma suggesting that this is a
     chronic finding.
     2.  Nonenhancing high attenuation material to the right of the esophagus and
     the posterior mediastinum.  This is new from the prior study, and likely
     represents a focal area of hemorrhage.  As it is intimately opposed to be
     esophagus, esophageal injury is also on the differential diagnosis, but there
     is no evidence of adjacent air. This could be further evaluated with
     fluoroscopic evaluation of the esophagus. Several air bubbles are seen in the
     anterior left neck just above the left clavicular head.  This could be due to
     prior attempted intravenous access.  It would be atypical for the hematoma to
     be originating from the aortic pseudoaneurysm as a fat plane is seen around
     the aorta.
     3.  Findings are worrisome for colonic adenocarcinoma in the hepatic flexure.
     Further evaluation with colonoscopy or CT colonography is recommended.  No
     focal liver lesions.
     4.  No evidence of acute traumatic intra-abdominal injury.
     5.  Multiple likely bilateral renal cysts.

     INDICATION:  Assess Dobbhoff tube placement.
     
     Portable semi-upright frontal radiograph.  Comparison is made to one day
     earlier.
     
     FINDINGS:
       
     The endotracheal tube and previously placed NG tube have been removed.  There
     has been placement of a Dobhoff feeding tube with its tip in the stomach. 
     Bibasilar patchy atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged in
     appearance.  Spinal fusion hardware is again identified in the lower cervical
     spine.  There have been no other changes compared to the study of 1 day
     earlier.
     
     IMPRESSION:
       
     Dobbhoff tube within the stomach.  Interval extubation.  Unchanged appearance
     of bibasilar pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.

     INDICATION:  An 84-year-old man status post cervical injury, evaluate for
     aspiration.
     
     VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS:  Study was performed with the speech
     pathologist.  Under video fluoroscopic guidance, multiple consistencies of
     barium were administered to the patient.  There is anterior and posterior
     surgical fusion hardware.  There is diffuse swelling and edema, particularly
     involving the epiglottis, which has difficulty reflecting.  There is delay in
     the initial oropharyngeal phase of the swallow, with premature spillover. With
     thin nectars, there was initially penetration and then frank aspiration, which
     was not able to be cleared with cough.  Due to the amount of aspiration, the
     study was terminated at this point.
     
     IMPRESSION: Significant paravertebral and epiglottic edema. Large amount of
     aspiration with nectar, after which the study was terminated. The patient will
     be re-evaluated after [**Hospital 1053**] rehabilitation. See speech pathologist report
     for more detail.

     HISTORY:  History of aspiration pneumonia and clogged G-tube.  Convert G to GJ
     tube.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to
     the patient's son, and telephone consent was obtained from the patient's son.
     Preprocedural timeout was performed to confirm the patient's identity and the
     procedure to be undertaken.
     
     Preliminary scout view demonstrated the gastrostomy tube tip to be within the
     stomach.  The gastrostomy tube was deflated.  A 0.035 Bentson guidewire was
     advanced through the gastrostomy tube and into the stomach.  The gastrostomy
     tube was removed, and a 6-French bright tip sheath was then advanced over the
     Bentson guidewire.  The inner stiffener of the sheath was removed, and a 5-
     French MPA catheter was then advanced through the sheath over the guidewire.
     Using combination of the MPA catheter and the Bentson guidewire, access was
     obtained beyond the pylorus into the duodenum and proximal jejunum.  The 0.035
     Bentson guidewire was then exchanged for a 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire.
     Both the sheath and the MPA catheter were then removed.  A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 1059**]
     gastrojejunostomy catheter was then advanced over the Amplatz Super Stiff wire
     with the tip beyond the ligament of Treitz, in the proximal jejunum.  The
     guidewire was removed, and a pigtail was formed within the mid portion of the
     catheter, within the second portion of the duodenum.  Using 5 cc of contrast,
     the tip of the gastrojejunostomy catheter was confirmed to be within the
     proximal jejunum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any
     immediate post-procedural complications.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of failed swallow in April of this year.  Presents for GJ
     tube replacement.  C5-6 subluxation status post fixation and history of
     stroke.  Incomplete quadriplegia.  Evaluate swallowing.
     
     VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:  Study was performed in conjunction with a speech
     pathologist.  Under video fluoroscopic guidance, multiple consistencies of
     barium were administered to the patient including nectar thick, honey and
     pudding.  There is a delayed oral phase with each of the consistencies.
     Aspiration occurs during swallowing of the nectar-thick liquid.  Aspiration
     does not occur with the pudding and honey consistencies.  When a small amount
     of aspiration occurred, there was no spontaneous cough.  When larger amounts
     of aspiration occurred, there was a spontaneous cough that was not effective
     in clearing the aspirated material.  After swallowing the honey and pudding
     consistencies, there is a small amount of residual barium within the
     valleculae.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Aspiration occurred with nectar liquids.  Honey and pudding were
     better tolerated by the patient.  Please see the report of the speech
     pathologist for additional details.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection, now with fever
     after multiple attempts at a right subclavian catheter.  Assess for
     pneumothorax.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to study performed 7 hours prior.  The
     tip of the right subclavian central venous catheter is not well seen but it
     appears to terminate within the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are
     persistent bibasilar opacities, in keeping with patient history of aspiration
     pneumonia.  There is increased confluence of the right basilar opacity in the
     short interval.  There may be small pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Satisfactory positioning of right subclavian central venous catheter
     without discernable pneumothorax.
     2.  Bibasilar opacities, consistent with thehistory of aspiration. Increasing
     confluence of right basilar opacity.  A dedicated PA and lateral radiograph is
     recommended when clinically feasible.

      urethra into the bladder. blood clots noted in the bladder
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Frank blood after Foley placement.  Evaluate Foley catheter
     placement.
     
     LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  Imaging over the bladder was performed.  The
     bladder is distended and contains echogenic material within the dependent
     portion, most consistent with hematoma.  A Foley catheter balloon was not
     clearly visualized within the bladder and appeared to lie within the
     prosthetic urethra.
     
     With the assistance of the emergency team, the Foley catheter balloon was
     deflated and under direct ultrasound guidance was repositioned back into the
     bladder.  Final images demonstrate the Foley catheter balloon to be located
     within the bladder with surrounding echogenic material noted, consistent with
     hematoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Foley catheter balloon initially located within the prosthetic urethra
     with hematoma noted in the bladder.
     2.  Successful repositioning of the Foley catheter balloon within the bladder
     with echogenic debris noted around the catheter, consistent with hematoma.

     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: After the risks and benefits were explained to the
     patient's son, verbal informed consent was obtained over the phone. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. The left upper quadrant
     and the preexisting GJ tube was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion. Pre-procedure time-out was performed to confirm the patient's name,
     procedure, and site. Initial scout film confirmed the position of the
     preexisting G-J tube. A stiff Glidewire was advanced through the preexisting
     tube with the tip in the proximal jejunum. The G-J tube was then removed and a
     new 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 1059**] gastrojejunostomy tube was placed over the wire with the
     tip in the proximal jejunum. Contrast was injected through the X-ray film
     confirmed the appropriate position of the tip of the G-J tube. The tube was
     capped and secured with skin.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful replacement of a new 14-French gastrojejunostomy tube,
     with the tip in the proximal jejunum. Ready for use.

     procedure, and site. Initial scout film confirmed the position of the
     preexisting G-J tube. A stiff Glidewire was advanced through the preexisting
     tube with the tip in the proximal jejunum. The G-J tube was then removed and a
     new 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 1059**] gastrojejunostomy tube was placed over the wire with the
     tip in the proximal jejunum. Contrast was injected through the X-ray film
     confirmed the appropriate position of the tip of the G-J tube. The tube was
     capped and secured with skin.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful replacement of a new 14-French gastrojejunostomy tube,
     with the tip in the proximal jejunum. Ready for use.
