Admission Date:  [**3484-12-18**]       Discharge Date:

Date of Birth:                    Sex:

Service:  NEUROLOGY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 5353**] is an
82-year-old gentleman, former physician at this institution.
He has a known history of Alzheimer's disease, hypertension,
non-Q-wave MI, atrial fibrillation, CHF and hyperthyroidism.
The patient presented on the day of admission with new onset
of right-sided weakness and dysarthria.  He has been followed
in the Department of Behavioral Neurology for memory
difficulties and Alzheimer's disease.  But, he was apparently
at his baseline, which was talking and unable to be somewhat
minimally responsive until the morning of admission.  His
health aid heard a thump and saw that Dr. [**Known patient lastname 5353**] has fallen
to the floor.  He appeared weak on the right.  Speech was
unintelligible.  By the time of the EMTs arrived, his speech
was intelligible.  He appeared to be gaining strength in his
right arm.  However, upon arrival to the ED, he was again
weak in the right upper extremity and speech was
unintelligible.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History was as above.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aricept 10.
2.  Aspirin 81.
3.  Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
4.  Sertraline 150.
5.  Lasix 40.
6.  Amiodarone 200.
7.  Synthroid 125 mcg.
8.  Potassium 20 mEq.
9.  Vitamin E.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired pediatrician and he
does not smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient's blood
pressure was 180/100, heart rate 70.  GENERAL:  Head and neck
examination were normal except for some blood on the outside
of the right ear.  Neck showed no carotid bruits.  Heart
revealed regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs were clear.  Abdomen
was benign.  Extremities were warm without edema.
Neurological examination revealed that the patient awake, but
drowsy.  Speech is unintelligible and dysarthric.  He could
repeat very simple words, but no sentences.  He could not
read or name.  He could follow some simple midline commands.
When asked to do things with the right side, he would do the
same thing with the left side and he was unable to move the
right side at all.  Cranial nerve examination revealed pupils
equal and reactive.  There is decreased blink to threat on
the right, but this was unreliable.  Extraocular muscles are
intact without nystagmus.  There was no RAPD.  There was a
right facial droop with decreased excursion.  On motor
examination, bulk was normal.  He had decreased tone in the
right upper extremity.  Formal strength test was difficult,
but it appeared full on the left.  On the right, he had [**4-10**]
at the deltoid, triceps, and possibly [**2-11**] at the finger
extensors.  The right lower extremity was able to move
spontaneously.  Reflexes were brisk on the right upper
extremity, compared to the left.  The right toe was upgoing.
The left toe was down.  He appeared to respond less to pain
in the right upper extremity.

The MRI, with diffusion-light imaging was done.  This showed
two areas of restrictive diffusion in the posterior portion
and in the posterior-superior region of the temporal lobe.
There were no areas of abnormal susceptibility.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for observation to
the ICU.  His blood pressure was controlled.  He was given
IVTPA, but showed no real improvement.  He did not require
intubation.  He was transferred to the floor on [**3484-12-19**].
Repeat CT scan showed no evidence of bleed.  Aspirin was
restarted.  The possibility of anticoagulation given with a
past medical history of atrial fibrillation was discussed
with the PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 5354**], the PCP felt that because of his
concomitant medical problems, as well as the fact that he had
only had intermittent trouble with atrial fibrillation in the
past, this was not something that he would recommend.  He did
not improve much at all over the course of the next few days.
Departments of Physical Therapy and Speech Therapy
consultations were obtained; results of which are still
pending at this time.  His blood pressure was somewhat
labile, ranging from the 120s to the 180s, close to the
previous antihypertensive dose.  Lopressor was added for
improved control and also because his heart rate tended to be
elevated.  The remainder of the hospital course will be
included in the discharge summary addendum.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  These will be included in the
addendum.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute stroke.
2.  Alzheimer's disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Non-Q-wave MI by history.
5.  Hemigastroplasty in the past.
6.  History of atrial fibrillation.
7.  History of cardiomyopathy.
8.  History of CHF.
9.  Hypothyroidism.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  Discharge plan will also be contained in the
addendum.

     INDICATION: New onset right hemiparesis and aphasia with status post TPA.
     
     COMPARISON: MRI of same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without IV contrast.
     
     FINDINGS: There are no intra or extraaxial hemorrhage, edema, or shift of
     normal midline structures. The ventricles are symmetric in size. There is
     tortuousity of the vertebral and basilar arteries as was seen on the MRA.
     
     White matter hypodensity and volume loss are seen, and reflect microvascular
     ischemia and infarction.  An acute infarction may be difficult to discern,
     given the gliotic changes. Overall cortical density appears to be preserved.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

     HISTORY:  Right sided weakness and aphasia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images were performed. Additional
     diffusion weighted images were performed.
     
     MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage. There is
     no mass, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. There is
     moderate symmetrical enlargement of the ventricles and sulci compatible with
     age related atrophy.  There is a moderate to severe amount of periventricular
     T2 hyperintensity consistent with chronic white matter microvascular
     infarction and subsequent gliosis.  No major vascular territorial infarction
     is seen.  No areas of restricted diffusion are identified to suggest acute
     infarction.  The soft tissues, osseous structures and visualized paranasal
     sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:  3D time of flight images were performed and
     correlated with MIP multiplanar images.  No aneurysmal dilatation, diminuitive
     flow or segmental stenosis is seen.  A right vertebral dominant system is
     identified.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) No acute cerebral infarction.  2) Moderate atrophy with severe
     chronic white matter microvascular infarction.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple images of the head were obtained without IV contrast.
     
     UNENHANCED HEAD CT:  There is a new focus of low attenuation extending from
     the left posterior centrum semiovale to the region of the angular gyrus. Again
     noted is diffuse white matter hypodensity consistent with chronic
     microvascular ischemia.  There is no shift of normally midline structures or
     mass effect.  The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are mildly prominent
     consistent with age related involution.  There is loss of the normal [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-
     white matter differentiation within the above described new focus of
     hypodensity.
     
     The soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.

     extending into the region of the angular gyrus.  These findings are consistent

     COMPARISON:  [**3484-12-23**]
     
     FINDINGS:   There is a nasogastric tube which extends into the stomach, loops
     superiorly, and returns into the mid-esophagus with the tip at the approximate
     level of the aortic arch. There is partial resolution of the bilateral
     pericentral infiltrates consistent with improving pulmonary edema.  There is
     persistence of cardiomegaly with left ventricular predominance.  No new
     pulmonary infiltrates are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature cannot be assessed
     secondary to supine position, therefore heart failure cannot be ruled out.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Poorly positioned nasogastric tube with the tip in the mid-
     esophagus.  This finding was discussed by telephone with the referring house
     officer.
     2)  Interval decrease in bilateral pericentral infiltrates consistent with
     improving pulmonary edema.
