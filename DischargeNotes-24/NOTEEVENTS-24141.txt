2.  Right inguinal hernia repair.
3.  Ventral hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Allopurinol.
2.  Amiodarone.
3.  Lipitor.
4.  Cozaar.
5.  Lasix.
6.  Lopressor.
7.  Protonix.
8.  Prozac.
9.  Trazodone.
10. Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any history of tobacco,
alcohol or drug use.  The patient lives alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 95.8.  The patient's pulse was 58, blood
pressure 130/86, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 97%
in room air.  The patient's heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The patient had no costovertebral angle tenderness.  The
patient's abdomen was distended, tympanitic, with mildly
diffuse tenderness.  The patient had no rebound tenderness,
no guarding and no percussion tenderness.  The extremities
were without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  The patient had
trace heme positive stool on rectal examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's white blood cell count was
8.3, hematocrit 34.0, platelet count 253,000.  Urinalysis was
negative.  Chemistries were within normal limits.

The patient's electrocardiogram showed no changes from before
and sinus rhythm.

KUB showed no air fluid levels, no dilated loops of bowel, no
free air.  The patient's CT scan showed dilated small bowel
to about 4.0 centimeters, normal transition of bowel was
identified.  CT scan was also showed positive diverticulosis,
and decompressed distal small bowel.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for rule out small
bowel obstruction.  The patient was kept NPO, was started on
intravenous fluids.  Nasogastric tube was placed as was Foley
catheter.  On hospital day two, the patient was examined
regularly for detecting worsening abdominal symptoms.  The
patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and lysis of
adhesions secondary to worsening of her abdominal symptoms.
Surgery was performed on [**2802-12-21**].  Estimated blood loss was
200 cc and urine output during surgery was 230.  The patient
was given one unit of packed red blood cells and five units
of fresh frozen plasma.  The patient was given one liter of
LR.  The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit postoperatively for observation secondary to the
patient's age and the patient's significant past medical
history.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was kept NPO
with nasogastric tube in place and intravenous fluids
running.  Foley catheter was kept in place as well.
Cardiology consultation was obtained secondary to the
patient's history of congestive heart failure and aortic
stenosis.  Cardiology recommended that there is no indication
for Amiodarone at this time.  Cardiology also recommended
weaning the patient off Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure
support.

On postoperative day number two, the patient's blood pressure
was 211/57.  We attempted to keep the patient's blood
pressure at the 140 to 150 range secondary to the patient's
aortic stenosis.  Nitroglycerin drip was increased, as well
as Hydroxyzine was started.  On postoperative day number
three, the patient's blood pressure stabilized to acceptable
levels of 140s to 150s.  On postoperative day number four,
nasogastric tube was taken out.  On postoperative day number
five, the patient was doing a lot better.  The patient was
started on clear diet with diet being advanced as tolerated.
Dilaudid was discontinued and Tylenol was used for pain
control.  Blood pressure has been controlled by Lopressor.
Cozaar and Amiodarone have been discontinued.  On
postoperative day number six, the patient tolerated p.o.
diet.  Foley catheter was taken out.  On postoperative day
number six, the patient developed a left facial swelling
which was diagnosed to be parotiditis.  ENT was consulted who
recommended starting the patient on intravenous Unasyn and
hydration as well as sialogogues.  The patient's facial
swelling gradually resolved.  On postoperative day number
seven, the patient is well enough to be transferred to a
rehabilitation facility for further rehabilitation.  The
patient is currently awaiting discharge to a rehabilitation
facility pending available beds.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous twice a day.

3.  Insulin sliding scale.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Tylenol p.r.n.
9.  Unasyn three grams intravenously q6hours for seven days
([**2803-1-3**]) until culture and sensitivity comes back.  We will
contact the rehabilitation facility with the results.
10. The patient needs to be restarted on Lasix, Amiodarone,
Cozaar and Coumadin per Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4727**] recommendations.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] will be following the patient at the rehabilitation
facility.

FOLLOW-UP:

patient will be caring for the patient at the rehabilitation
facility.

4.  The patient also will be needing chest physical therapy
q4hours, and Milkinol to parotid duct three times a day.  The

                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     INDICATION:  84 year old woman with inability to tolerated PO intake and
     abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis, with the administration of oral and IV
     contrast.  Coronal reformatted images were performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a small right pleural effusion
     and a small amount of atelectasis at both lung bases.  The liver is
     unremarkable.  There is a large gallstone within the gallbladder, without
     evidence of associated inflammatory changes.  The pancreas, spleen, adrenal
     glands and kidneys are unremarkable.  There are multiple loops of dilated
     small bowel, measuring up to approximately 4 cm in greatest diameter.  The
     dilation of the bowel appears to begin in the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum
     and ends somewhere in the region of the distal jejunum/proximal ileum.  No
     definite transition point is visualized.  There is a moderate amount of free
     ascites.  No free air is identified.  A prior ventral abdominal hernia repair
     is noted.  The abdominal vasculature demonstrates marked degree of
     calcifications throughout the aorta, mesenteric, renal and iliac vessels,
     which all appear otherwise patent.  Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal
     lymph nodes are noted, that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic
     enlargement.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  The rectum is unremarkable. There
     is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. The
     bladder is unremarkable.  There is a small-to-moderate amount of free pelvic
     fluid.  No deep pelvic lymphadenopathy.  The colon and distal ileum appear
     otherwise relatively collapsed.
     
     Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Numerous loops of dilated small bowel, which appears to predominantly
     affect the jejunum.  Although no distinct transition point is identified this
     is highly suspicious for a small bowel obstruction.  The distal ileum and
     colon are relatively collapsed.
                                                                 (Over)
