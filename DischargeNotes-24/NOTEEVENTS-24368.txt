                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Fever and neutropenia, clinical exam worrisome for pulmonary
     process.
     
     COMPARISON:  Portable AP [**3159-7-22**] and PA and lateral [**3159-7-4**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:   The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within
     normal limits.  On the lateral film, there are at least three, rounded nodular
     densities which were not present on the previous lateral study from [**3159-7-4**].
     Two of these rounded nodules appear posteriorly overlying the vertebrae and
     the third is within the superior mediastinum anteriorly.  These nodules are
     not well visualized on the PA film.  There may be one within the left lower
     lobe, anterior to the left heart border.  The lungs otherwise are clear. There
     are no pleural effusions.  The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     New, round opacities seen on the lateral film which were not present on the
     previous study.  These are difficult to identify on the AP film.  As this
     patient is pre-operative for bone marrow transplant, a CT is recommended to
     further assess these opacities.

     COMPARISON:  [**3159-2-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis following the administration of 120 cc of IV
     optiray.  Non-ionic contrast was administered secondary to patient's debility.
      Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Within the left lower lobe, there has
     been interval development of a new non-calcified pulmonary nodule measuring
     2.0 x 1.8 cm, with spiculated borders, findings suggestive of an infectious
     etiology.  Additionally, a second smaller non-calcified round pulmonary nodule
     is identified within the right lower lobe, which was not seen on the prior
     study, measuring 6 mm.  A tiny left pleural effusion is present.
     
     The liver is normal without evidence of focal hepatic masses.  Tiny layering
     gallstones are seen within the gallbladder without evidence of pericholecystic
     fluid, intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, or gallbladder wall
     edema.  The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, both kidneys, proximal ureters,
     stomach, and loops of small bowel are all within normal limits.  Trace amount
     of free fluid is seen within the abdomen adjacent to the right paracolic
     gutter.  There is no free air.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  No
     significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The sigmoid colon is not well distended
     with contrast, however, the wall appears indistinct, thickened, and
     hypoenhancing.  Similar changes appear within the distal segment of the
     descending colon.  There is no pericolonic fat stranding, evidence of
     perforation, obstruction, or abscess formation.  No diverticula are noted.
     Contrast is seen in the rectum.  A small amount of free fluid is seen within
     the pelvis.  Distal ureters, bladder, prostate are all within normal limits.
     No significant pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is present.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and saagittal reconstructions were essential in
     delineating the wall thickening and hypoenhancement of the descending colon
     and sigmoid colon.
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Ill-defined thickening of the wall of the descending and sigmoid colon
     with hypoenhancement, findings likely suggestive of an inflammatory process
     such as infection, inflammatory bowel disease, and less likely ischemia. There
     is no evidence of bowel obstruction, perforation, or adjacent inflammatory fat
     stranding.
     2)  Interval development of new spiculated lesion within the lower lobe, which
     may represent an infectious process.  Neoplastic process is less likely given
     the time course of this lesion.  Interval development of new pulmonary nodule
     within the right lower lobe.  Tiny left pleural effusion.
     3)  Trace amount of free fluid within the abdomen, and small amount of free
     fluid within the pelvis.
     4)  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  CLL, bloody diarrhea, fever, neutropenia.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3159-2-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis following the administration of 120 cc of IV
     optiray.  Non-ionic contrast was administered secondary to patient's debility.
      Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Within the left lower lobe, there has
     been interval development of a new non-calcified pulmonary nodule measuring
     2.0 x 1.8 cm, with spiculated borders, findings suggestive of an infectious
     etiology.  Additionally, a second smaller non-calcified round pulmonary nodule
     is identified within the right lower lobe, which was not seen on the prior
     study, measuring 6 mm.  A tiny left pleural effusion is present.
     
     The liver is normal without evidence of focal hepatic masses.  Tiny layering
     gallstones are seen within the gallbladder without evidence of pericholecystic
     fluid, intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, or gallbladder wall
     edema.  The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, both kidneys, proximal ureters,
     stomach, and loops of small bowel are all within normal limits.  Trace amount
     of free fluid is seen within the abdomen adjacent to the right paracolic
     gutter.  There is no free air.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  No
     significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The sigmoid colon is not well distended
     with contrast, however, the wall appears indistinct, thickened, and
     hypoenhancing.  Similar changes appear within the distal segment of the
     descending colon.  There is no pericolonic fat stranding, evidence of
     perforation, obstruction, or abscess formation.  No diverticula are noted.
     Contrast is seen in the rectum.  A small amount of free fluid is seen within
     the pelvis.  Distal ureters, bladder, prostate are all within normal limits.
     No significant pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is present.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and saagittal reconstructions were essential in
     delineating the wall thickening and hypoenhancement of the descending colon
     and sigmoid colon.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  57 year old man with leukemia with pulmonary nodules.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the chest were obtained at end-
     inspiration without the administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  Additional
     selected images at end-expiration were also obtained.  Multiplanar reformatted
     images were also reconstructed.  Comparison is made with the previous CT study
     dated [**3159-2-8**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There are multiple ill-defined nodules with spiculated nodules,
     measuring 1-2 cm in diameter, three in the left lower lobe and one in the left
     upper lobe. The bronchus are seen going into these nodules.  These nodules
     were not detected in the previous CT scan.
     
     There are tiny sub-centimeter nodules in right lower lobe and right upper lobe
     and left upper lobe.  These nodules have not been changed since the previous
     study.
     
     There is a small left pleural effusion.
     
     The patient has tiny ascites, which has been continued since the previous
     study.
     
     There is no lymphadenopathy.
     
     There are no apparent abnormalities in bony structures.
     
     The reformatted images confirm the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) New multiple ill-defined nodular opacities were noted, three in the left
     lower lobe and one in the left upper lobe.  These nodules are highly
     suggestive of fungal infection, especially invasive aspergillosis.
     
     2) Multiple tiny nodules in bilateral lungs have not been changed since the
     previous study.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Acute leukemia and fever and lung nodules.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial 5-mm CT images of the chest were obtained without
     administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  Comparison is made with the previous CT
     study dated [**3159-7-24**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again noted are bilateral multiple ill-defined nodules and
     consolidations, surrounded by the ground-glass opacities, which have increased
     in size compared to the previous study.  The bilateral pleural effusions have
     also increased.
     
     There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  In the posterior part of
     the trachea, small soft tissue density is noted, most likely representing
     mucous secretion.
     
     In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, a small gallstone is noted.
     Note is made of a small effusion around the galblladder, which is not enlarged
     or thickened.  There is a small amount of ascites anterior to the liver. Again
     noted is a small nodular region anterior to the spleen, suggesting accessory
     spleen.  There is a small possible Morgagni hernia.
     
     There is no sclerotic or lytic lesion in the bony structurers.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Increased bilateral patchy consoliations with increased pleural effusion,
     suggesting worsening infection, most likely fungal.
     2. Small fluid adjacent to the gallbladder with gallstones which may represent
     inflammation.  Please correlate clinically and perfoem further evaluation with
     ultrasound if needed.
     3.Small ascites anterior to liver.
