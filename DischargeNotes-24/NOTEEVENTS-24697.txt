History of Present Illness:
45M with history of alcoholism presented to OSH with hematemesis 
and now transferred to [**Hospital1 25**] for actively bleeding gastric 
varices.
.
The patient was in his USOH until the night prior to admission, 
when after drinking approximately a pint of hard liquor, his 
wife found him ""about to pass out"" and she lowered him onto the 
bed.  His eyes subsequently rolled back and she called 911, but 
patient refused transport. EMTs were called once this happened 
again.  The wife was later contacted by the police who were 
contacted by someone who witnessed the patient pull to the side 
of the road in his truck and discard his clothing, which were 
soaked in blood.  The patien later admitted to vomiting a 
""bucket-full"" of blood on his clothes in his truck. 
.
At OSH, pt vomited 1800cc of blood. BP 87/54, HR 139. His hct 
was 28 and his INR 2.3 and he received 2U PRBC and 2U FFP. He 
was started on octreotide and levofloxacin and underwent an EGD 
which showed 4cm gastric fundic varices with active bleeding.  
Stomach was full of old and new blood.  No noted esophageal 
bleeding lesions.  Nothing was treated endoscopically and the 
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 25**] for octreotide and for TIPS 
procedure.
.
In [**Hospital1 25**] ED, pt noted to be tachycardic in 120s-140s with BP 
120/80 and hct 32.1.  He was given 10mg IV Valium x 3, banana 
bag, calcium gluconate 2g, Octreotide 50mcg/hr and pantoprazole 
40mg IV x 1. Denies N/V, abdominal pain, CP, SOB. Reports 
tremulousness.  He had an NG lavage which showed dark red blood 
which did not clear with 500cc. He was given 2U FFP in the ED.

.
CXR [**3408-10-25**]: 1. Confluent airspace opacities within the right 
and left lower lung zones, suggestive of multifocal pneumonia or 
aspiration.
2. Right IJ catheter is seen, with a kink in the proximal most 
portion. 
.
TIPS [**3408-10-25**]: 1) Portal hypertension with pressure gradient 
between the portal vein and hepatic vein measured 14 mmHg prior 
to formation of the portosystemic shunt. Large gastric varices 
were demonstrated. 2) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic 
shunt placement and alcohol embolization of two large gastric 
varices with good angiographic results was performed. The 
post-TIPS portosystemic pressure gradient was reduced to 9 mmHg. 
3) Placement of a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous 
catheter via the right internal jugular vein with the tip in the 
SVC, ready for use.
.
ECG [**3408-10-25**]: Sinus tachycardia; Modest diffuse nonspecific ST-T 
wave changes.
.
CXR [**3408-10-26**]: Increased opacification at the left lung base 
likely represents worsening pneumonia or aspiration. Improved 
aeration of the right lung base probably represents improving 
atelectasis.
.
RUQ u/s [**3408-10-26**]: The left portal vein is not visualized. There 
is hepatopetal flow within the main portal vein with velocities 
of approximately 15 cm/sec. The TIPS is poorly visualized. There 
appears to be wall-to-wall flow velocities of approximately 37, 
60, and 76 cm/sec returned from the proximal, mid, and distal 
TIPS respectively. The IVC is patent. There is no evidence of 
intra or perihepatic hematoma.
.
CT head [**3408-10-27**]: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal 
extra-axial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift. The 
ventricles and basal cisterns are unremarkable. The slightly 
lower attenuation of the left temporal lobe is thought to be 
artifactual given the slightly asymmetric positioning of the 
patient's head. There is no definite focal effacement in this 
area. Fluid in the ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses is 
probably secondary to endotracheal intubation.
.
CXR [**3408-10-27**]: Heterogeneous opacification at the right lung 
base, which cleared between [**10-25**] and 16, has recurred. 
Although I cannot exclude pneumonia, the sequence of events more 
likely reflects asymmetric edema accompanied by small bilateral 
pleural effusions. Left lower lobe atelectasis persists. The 
heart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax. Tip of 
endotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet is more than 8 cm from 
the carina, 4 cm above optimal placement. Tip of the right 
jugular sheath projects over the SVC. No pneumothorax or 
mediastinal widening.
.
ECG [**3408-10-27**]: Sinus rhythm. Non-diagnostic repolarization 
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**3408-10-25**] 
heart rate is slower. Otherwise, no major change.  
.
CXR [**3408-10-28**]: Consolidation in the lungs, particularly the left 
has increased substantially since [**9-25**], having improved 
between 15 and 16. Some of this may be due to pulmonary edema 
but worsening pneumonia, particularly in the left lung is 
presumed. Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin 
of the clavicles, more than 8 cm from the carina and 4 cm above 
optimal placement. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and 
out of view. Right internal jugular sheath projects over the 
expected course of the right internal jugular vein, but is 
sharply folded proximally. There is at least a small left 
pleural effusion. The heart is top normal size and unchanged. 
There is no pneumothorax.
.

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
A 45yoM with history of alcoholism presented with large amount 
of hematemesis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 25**] for actively 
bleeding gastric varices seen on EGD.
.
1. GI bleed: The Pt. was admitted with a history and LFT pattern 
consistent with alcoholic liver failure/cirrhosis.  The Pt. was 
transfused with pRBCs for goal Hct>30.  The patient was started 
on octreotide gtt, levofloxacin (per data showing benefit with 
esophageal varices) for 10 days, and IV protonix.  The patient 
was evaluated by the liver/gi service and underwent the TIPS 
procedure.  Following the TIPS procedure, the Pt's hematocrit 
remained stable, and transaminases and NH3 trended down toward 
normal levels, although bilirubin levels increased.  The patient 
had an NG tube placed, and was treated with lactulose and 
rifaximin, and tube feeds were started on hospital day 4.  
.
2. Fever: The Pt. had persistent fevers upon admission.  
Initially Pt. had no signs of infection, and neuro exam (pupils, 
extremity tone) was unchanged.  A head CT was negative.  Due to 
liver disease, Pt. was not treated with acetaminophen; instead a 
cooling blanket was used.  Due to concern for an aspiration 
pneumonia, the Pt. was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin 
on admission.  Fluid from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) grew 4+ 
gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  Vancomycin was added 
to the regimen for improved gram positive coverage.  
.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated upon admission 
for airway protection, and maintained on assist control 
ventilation with propofol sedation.  
The Pt's pCO2 was allowed to run around 55, and CPAP + pressure 
support trials were initiated, which the Pt. seemed to tolerate. 
 By hospital day 4, the Pt. was off sedation, but still remained 
asleep and essentially unresponsive.  Fentanyl gtt was titrated 
to Pt. comfort while ETT tube was in place.
.
4. Hepatitis: Pt. was admitted with elevated LFTs, likely a 
result of alcoholic cirrhosis, especially given transaminase 
ratio AST:ALT > 2:1.  Presence of gastric varices points to 
cirrhosis.  The patient underwent the TIPS procedure and was 
treated with rifaximin as above.  Viral and autoimmune 
serologies were negative for Hep B and Hep C but positive for 
Hep A, and a ceruloplasmin level was found to be 16 (low).  
Following the TIPS procedure, the Pt's LFTs normalized, however, 
the bilirubin increased from 9.9 up to 25.4.  The etiology of 
this was thought to be either TIPS-induced liver dysfunction vs. 
post-op jaundice and sepsis. On hospital day 7 the pt began to 
show signs of acute renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome was 
considered likely, with the normalizing LFTs actually 
representing loss of synthetic liver function.
.
5. Alcoholism: Pt's last alcoholic drink was [**10-23**].  
Tremulousness and tachycardia on admission were likely related 
to alcohol withdrawal.  The patient was treated with valium 
5-10mg Q1H:PRN dosed according to a CIWA Scale.
.
#. Psych: The Pt. has a history of depression, anxiety and 
substance abuse.  Urine toxicology on admission was positive for 
cocaine, though wife did not know about a history of drug abuse. 
 Social Work and substance abuse were consulted and met with the 
Pt. after he woke up.  He was also treated with a nicotine 
patch.
.
#. Tachycardia: Likely related to both active GI bleed and 
hypovolemia as well as alcohol withdrawal given concomitant 
tremulousness.  Initial management addressed hemodynamic 
stability and fluid resuscitation, and then the Pt. was treated 
with nadolol, which has non-specific beta 1&2 blocking activity. 
 
.
6. ARF: Creatinine normalized initially. Pt. was initially 
prerenal related to blood loss.  Cr normalized following 
fluid/blood product resuscitation, and Is/Os were monitored 
throughout hospitalization. On hospital day 7, the Cr began to 
rise dramatically, and hepatorenal syndrome was considered 
likely. The renal service was involved to monitor his 
requirements for hemodialysis.
.
7. Metabolic acidosis:  Anion gap initially 27, likely related 
to alcoholic ketoacidosis, closed following TIPS procedure and 
resolution of transaminitis.  Electrolytes were monitored and 
aggresively repleted.
.
8. FEN: The patient was initially given thiamine, folate, D5, 
MVI, and electrolytes were monitored and repleted.  After 
placement of an NG-tube, tube feeds were started with free water 
boluses via NG tube for hypernatremia 250cc Q4H + 1L D5 today 
(free water deficit was ~7L).  Erythromycin IV was used to 
encourage forward gi motility.
.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient wore pneumoboots and was treated 
with IV protonix during the time he was sedated/intubated.
.
As the hepatorenal syndrome worsened, the liver and renal 
services felt that the patient's prognosis was extremely poor 
and thus recommended against hemodialysis given that the patient 
was unlikely to recover. After several family discussions, the 
family decided to withdraw care. The patient expired on 
[**3408-11-4**].

      varices.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      TIPS

     HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
     bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 675**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4062**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5168**], and the
     attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
     patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
     4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**]
     wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
     and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
     through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
     vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
     help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
     appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein. 
     The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed. 
     The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
     performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
     vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.
     
     After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
     [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**] wire through the vascular sheath
     until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
     was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
     injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
     Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
     the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
     demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
     hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
     of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
     catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
     selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
     from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
     from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
     advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
     removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
     balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
     Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
     vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
     follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
     shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
     the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
     0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
     coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
     displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
     snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
     vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
     Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
     with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
     catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
     catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
     within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
     was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
     mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg. 
     This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
     portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
     balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
     performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
     within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over

     HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
     bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 675**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4062**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5168**], and the
     attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
     patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
     4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**]
     wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
     and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
     through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
     vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
     help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
     appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein. 
     The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed. 
     The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
     performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
     vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.
     
     After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
     [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**] wire through the vascular sheath
     until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
     was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
     injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
     Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
     the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
     demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
     hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
     of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
     catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
     selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
     from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
     from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
     advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
     removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
     balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
     Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
     vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
     follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
     shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
     the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
     0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
     coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
     displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
     snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
     vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
     Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
     with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
     catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
     catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
     within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
     was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
     mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg. 
     This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
     portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
     balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
     performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
     within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over
     the wire and a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter was
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
     bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 675**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4062**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5168**], and the
     attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
     patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
     4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**]
     wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
     and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
     through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
     vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
     help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
     appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein. 
     The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed. 
     The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
     performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
     vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.
     
     After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
     [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**] wire through the vascular sheath
     until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
     was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
     injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
     Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
     the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
     demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
     hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
     of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
     catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
     selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
     from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
     from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
     advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
     removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
     balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
     Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
     vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
     follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
     shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
     the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
     0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
     coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
     displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
     snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
     vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
     Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
     with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
     catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
     catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
     within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
     was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
     mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg. 
     This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
     portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
     balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
     performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
     within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over
     the wire and a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter was
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
     bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 675**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4062**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5168**], and the
     attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
     patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
     4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**]
     wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
     and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
     through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
     vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
     help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
     appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein. 
     The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed. 
     The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
     performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
     vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.
     
     After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
     [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**] wire through the vascular sheath
     until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
     was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
     injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
     Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
     the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
     demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
     hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
     of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
     catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
     selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
     from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
     from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
     advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
     removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
     balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
     Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
     vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
     follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
     shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
     the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
     0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
     coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
     displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
     snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
     vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
     Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
     with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
     catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
     catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
     within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
     was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
     mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg. 
     This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
     portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
     balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
     performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
     within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over
     the wire and a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter was
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
     bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 675**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4062**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5168**], and the
     attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
     patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
     4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**]
     wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
     and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
     through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
     vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
     help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
     appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein. 
     The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed. 
     The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
     performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
     vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.
     
     After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
     [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**] wire through the vascular sheath
     until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
     was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
     injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
     Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
     the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
     demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
     hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
     of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
     catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
     selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
     from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
     from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
     advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
     removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
     balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
     Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
     vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
     follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
     shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
     the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
     0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
     coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
     displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
     snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
     vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
     Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
     with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
     catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
     catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
     within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
     was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
     mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg. 
     This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
     portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
     balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
     performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
     within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over
     the wire and a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter was
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
     bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 675**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4062**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5168**], and the
     attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
     patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
     4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**]
     wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
     and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
     through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
     vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
     help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
     appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein. 
     The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed. 
     The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
     performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
     vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.
     
     After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
     [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**] wire through the vascular sheath
     until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
     was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
     injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
     Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
     the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
     demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
     hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
     of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
     catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
     selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
     from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
     from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
     advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
     removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
     balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
     Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
     vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
     follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
     shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
     the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
     0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
     coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
     displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
     snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
     vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
     Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
     with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
     catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
     catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
     within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
     was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
     mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg. 
     This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
     portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
     balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
     performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
     within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over
     the wire and a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter was
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
     bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 675**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4062**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5168**], and the
     attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
     patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
     4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**]
     wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
     and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
     through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
     vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
     help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
     appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein. 
     The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed. 
     The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
     performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
     vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.
     
     After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
     [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**] wire through the vascular sheath
     until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
     was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
     injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
     Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
     the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
     demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
     hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
     of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
     catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
     selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
     from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
     from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
     advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
     removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
     balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
     Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
     vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
     follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
     shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
     the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
     0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
     coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
     displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
     snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
     vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
     Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
     with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
     catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
     catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
     within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
     was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
     mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg. 
     This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
     portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
     balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
     performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
     within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over
     the wire and a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter was
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      45 year old man with likely alcoholic cirrhosis and acutely bleeding gastric 
      varices.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      TIPS

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
     bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 675**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4062**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5168**], and the
     attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
     patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
     4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**]
     wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
     and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
     through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
     vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
     help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
     appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein. 
     The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed. 
     The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
     performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
     vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.
     
     After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
     [**Doctor Last Name 5169**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100**] wire through the vascular sheath
     until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
     was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
     injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
     Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
     the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
     demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
     hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
     14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
     of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
     catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
     selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
     from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
     from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
     advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
     removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
     balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
     Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
     vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
     follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
     shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
     the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
     0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
     coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
     displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
     snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
     vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
     Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
     with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
     catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
     catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
     within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
     was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
     mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg. 
     This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
     portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
     balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
     performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
     within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over
     the wire and a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter was
                                                                 (Over)

     final AP chest x-ray.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     CONTRAST MEDIA:  200 cc of nonionic contrast material was used.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Portal hypertension with pressure gradient between the portal vein and
     hepatic vein measured 14 mmHg prior to formation of the portosystemic shunt. 
     Large gastric varices were demonstrated.
     
     2)  Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and alcohol
     embolization of two large gastric varices with good angiographic results was
     performed.  The post-TIPS portosystemic pressure gradient was reduced to 9
     mmHg.
     
     3)  Placement of a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter via the
     right internal jugular vein with the tip in the SVC, ready for use.

     ULTRASOUND GUIDED TIPS IMAGING:
     
     INDICATION:  The patient day one post TIPS.  For baseline study.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color flow, and pulse wave Doppler insonation of the
     liver, its vessels, and of the TIPS shunt was performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  The examination is technically extremely difficult because of the
     patient's liver echotexture and also because patient was ventilated.
     
     REPORT:
     
     The left portal vein is not visualized.  There is hepatopetal flow within the
     main portal vein with velocities of approximately 15 cm/sec.  The TIPS is
     poorly visualized.  There appears to be wall-to-wall flow velocities of
     approximately 37, 60, and 76 cm/sec returned from the proximal, mid, and
     distal TIPS respectively.  The IVC is patent.  There is no evidence of intra
     or perihepatic hematoma.
     
     The visualized portions of the hepatic arteries appear normal.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     Extremely limited examination.  A further baseline examination may be of
     benefit once the patient has been weaned from his ventilator.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      45 year old man with EtOH abuse p/w gastric varices and alcoholic hepatits s/p 
      TIPS                            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please evaluate TIPS flow by doppler and compare with prior study.              
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of EtOH abuse, with gastric varices and alcoholic
     hepatitis, status post TIPS.  Evaluate TIPS.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3408-10-26**].
     
     DOPPLER STUDY OF THE LIVER:  The liver demonstrates a diffusely coarsened and
     nodular appearance, consistent with cirrhosis.  No focal lesion identified.
     The gallbladder wall demonstrates edema, consistent with chronic liver
     disease.  No gallstones, pericholecystic fluid, or gallbladder distention is
     identified.  There is a trace amount of perihepatic ascites.
     
     Doppler sonography was performed of the liver.  Wall-to-wall flow was
     demonstrated within the TIPS.  Peak systolic velocities within the proximal,
     mid, and distal portions of the TIPS were 70, 130, and 165 cm per second.  The
     main portal vein was patent, demonstrated centripetal flow, and had peak
     systolic velocity of 26 cm per second.  There was reversed flow within the
     left portal vein and the anterior branch of the right portal vein.  The IVC
     and hepatic veins are patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Normal functioning TIPS, which demonstrates wall-to-wall flow and normal
     peak systolic velocities.
     2.  Coarsened appearance to the liver, consistent with cirrhosis.
     3.  Gallbladder wall edema, consistent with underlying chronic liver disease.
     4.  Trace ascites.

 Pt's tmax 99.9, HR remains in NSR with no ectopy 70's. BP has slowly risen throughout the day. Did not receive any IVF bolluses, in fact IVF were d/c'd and plan is currently to use albumin and blood products. Pt was transfused with 1u PRBC not for low hct but to increase intervascular volume. Renal would like to keep SBP>120, if not acheived with transfusion and albumin they recommend to start pressors. Pt's weight is up and is still >4L+ already for the day. Urine output is better but still marginal ~25-30cc/hr. Current BP 120/66. MICU team did not want to check any labs this afternoon/evening and next labs are ordered for AM. Renal team obtained consent from wife tonight in case it's necessary to start dialysis tomorrow. Pt still does not have any dialysis access and would require FFP to correct INR prior to line insertion. Wife is aware of possibility of having to start dialysis tomorrow.
 Pt is still on AC for ventilation 550x12 breathing on average 18bpm. Pt's sats did drop down to 90% and did not come up with suctioning so FiO2 was increased from 50% to 70% and sats are currently 96%. Pt is requiring frequent suctioning for very thick green/becoming more brown secretions. CPT done a few times today.
 Pt is tolerating TF today. Laculose was given a couple of times and FIB leaked after being incontinent of a large amt of loose stool. FIB was replaced and emptied for 200cc of loose golden stool. Cdiff spec was resent early this am. 
 Neurologically pt appears a little lighter today. Moving head a lot more and seems to move it to voice stimulation and definitely to physical stimulation. Pt moves BUE on bed to nail bed stim -no movement noted in BLE. Pupils remain equal and reactive.
 Family (wife, son, mother, 2 sisters, and nephew were in to visit) renal MD updated wife as to current plan. Social worker also stopped by to speak with wife and assist in filling out some forms.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 638**] notified but d/t pt's hypercoagulated state decided to leave current tube in place to avoid risk of bleed upon removal since replacement tube would not be placed without correcting coags and resident wants to wait until day shift to address issue. Therefore TF were off all night and no po meds were given. Pt still had +stool and required FIB to be changed. Skin around rectum macerated and some sloughing noted. 3M barrier wipes used to protect skin and FIB was replaced.
 Neurologically presenting lighter then previous 24hrs -opens eyes to voice but does not follow any commands. Withdraws all extremeties to nailbed pressure. Pt noted to be having a lot of muscle twitches. 
 Wife expressing frustration with the worsening of renal status and that MD's have been talking about starting CVVHD but have not taken any action at this time. Wife would like to proceede with dialysis as soon as possible. 
PLAN:
 Social worker may need to plan family meeting including MICU, Renal and Liver teams
 ? start CVVHD
 maintain MAP>60
 ? correct coags and replace NGT and place dialysis cath
 Minimize fluid
 Pulmonary toilet
