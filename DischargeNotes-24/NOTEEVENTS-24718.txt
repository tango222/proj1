CHIEF COMPLAINT:  GI bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old man
with a history of prostate cancer treated with radiation and
diverticulosis and grade 3 hemorrhoids who was admitted with
shortness of breath and dizziness with ""weeks"" of blood and
dark stools.  He denied any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
fevers or chills.  The patient had a recent admission on [**3-14**]
for garbled speech.  He was found to be anemic at that time,
thought secondary to GI bleed.  He was originally seen at
[**Hospital6 **] for this admission where his
hematocrit was found to be 19.  Rectal exam showed some
guaiac positive stool and some frank, bright red blood.  The
patient has a history of diverticular bleed and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5924**]
follows the patient for his GI problems.  The patient was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 4**] for
further management.

In the Emergency Room the patient was orthostatic.  He was
coherent, in no acute distress.  He passed two large jelly
consisting stools with bright red clots.  The volume was
approximately 5 inches in diameter.  In the Emergency Room
the patient refused NG tube for lavage.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Prostate cancer status post
radiation.  2) Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  3)
Rectal bleed in [**2801**].  4) Grade 3 hemorrhoids.  5) TIAs.  6)
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  7) Diverticulosis as seen on
a colonoscopy in 4/00, also noted on that colonoscopy was a
rectal ulcer.  8) Melanoma status post excision.  9) He had
an exercise treadmill test in [**2796**] which was normal.

MEDICATIONS:  Multivitamin, Sertraline 50 mg po q d,
Verapamil 180 mg po q d, Moexipril 50 mg po q d, Colace 100
mg po q d, Cilium, Aspirin 81 mg po q d, and Iron 325 mg tid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a remote smoking history.
He denies current alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.6, heart rate 88 with
blood pressure 136/60 lying flat, sitting up his systolic
blood pressure fell to 106 with a stable heart rate.  In
general, he is an elderly man sitting in bed in no acute
distress.  He is a very poor historian.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact, pale
sclera.  Neck, no lymphadenopathy and supple.  Chest clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac exam, regular rate and
rhythm, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper
sternal border.  Abdominal exam, soft, nontender, non
distended, well healed midline scar, guaiac positive with
brown stool.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.1, hematocrit 18.8, last
checked on [**3-22**] when it was 27.6.  Platelet count 158,000.
INR 1.2, PTT 31.1, SMA 7 145, 4.1, 107, 29, 27, 1.2 which is
down from 1.8 on [**3-17**], glucose 144.  EKG, normal sinus rhythm
at 92, axis 0, normal intervals.  There is S in 2, 3 and AVF
with pseudonormalization of T waves V5 and V6.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 76-year-old man with history of
diverticular and hemorrhoidal GI bleeds with a history of
radiation proctitis secondary to his XRT for prostate cancer.
He presents to the Emergency Room with shortness of breath
after ""weeks"" of dark brown stools and bright red blood per
rectum.  He has a hematocrit of 19.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day #1 the patient was admitted
to the medical ICU where he received multiple blood
transfusions.  Later that day with a stable hematocrit he was
transferred to the floor.  A GI consultation was called.  The
patient was prepped for a colonoscopy for hospital day #2.
On hospital day #2 the colonoscopy was performed that showed
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon with
grade 3 mixed hemorrhoids.  The colonoscopy was otherwise
normal to the cecum.  These findings suggested that the
diverticula were the source of the patient's bleeding.  The
patient received more blood transfusions over the course of
the day.  On hospital day #3, [**3-29**], the patient received one
more unit of blood with no more bright red blood per rectum.
On hospital day #4, [**3-30**], the day of discharge, the patient's
hematocrit was stable in the morning after the last
transfusion the day before.  The patient had no recurrences
of his bright red blood per rectum.  The patient was
discharged in stable condition to home.  The patient was
instructed to resume his outpatient medications upon arrival
at home.  The patient has an appointment with his primary
care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3989**] on [**3-31**].  At that time Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3989**] will check a CBC and will closely follow the
patient.  The patient was instructed to consume a high fiber
diet.  On [**3-30**] the patient was discharged in stable condition
with a diagnosis of lower GI bleeding secondary to
diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.  The patient had visiting
nurse services prior to admission.  These will be resumed on
discharge.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a  dose of 
     approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.  No significant ST segment changes or symptoms 
     were elicited.
      
     HISTORY:  Seventy-seven year old man with h/o atrial fibrillation, referred for
     arrhythmia evaluation preoperatively.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion, 
     MIBI was administered IV.
      
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
      
     Stress and resting perfusion images demonstrate a mild, near completely
     reversible inferior wall defect.
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of
     approximately 47%, with relative hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Mild, near completely reversible inferior wall perfusion defect
     with associated hypokinesis. /nkg

     This examination consists of three views of the right femur including right
     knee.  There is a Zickel-type fixation device in the proximal femur with short
     intramedullary rod and associated screw extending into the femoral head.
      Specific views of the right hip were not ordered or obtained and assessment
     of this fixation is inadequate.  There are skin staples laterally.  No
     fracture is seen in the mid- or distal femur and the suboptimal knee films are
     within normal limits.  Comparison study is not available.

     INDICATIONS:  Right lower lobe pneumonia.  Increasing oxygen requirement and
     hypoxia.  SOB.  Check current status. 
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  A single, AP supine view.  Comparison is made to previous
     films from [**2806-2-26**].  An endotracheal tube has now been inserted. The lungs are
     better inflated.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted, with posterior
     layering, more marked on the right side.  The heart shows slight left
     ventricular enlargement. The aorta is slightly unfolded.  External pacing
     electrodes are noted overlying the right mid zone laterally and the left lower
     zone laterally.  There may be some left lower lobe collapse/consolidation
     behind the heart, partly obscured by the effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Better lung inflation following intubation. Bilateral effusions
     again demonstrated.  Port-A-Cath in good position. Possible left lower lobe
     collapse/consolidation.

     HISTORY: Right lower lobe pneumonia and increasing O2 requirement, question
     progression of right lower lobe infiltrate.
     
     Chest, single AP supine portable view.
     
     Compared with [**2806-2-22**], the ET tube has been removed. There is moderately
     severe cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution. Doubt overt CHF. There is
     a small right pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis. There has been
     some interval improvement in the alveolar opacity at the right base. There is
     persistent increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
     collapse and/or consolidation. Right subclavian central line tip over distal
     SVC. No pneumothorax identified. I suspect the presence of underlying
     hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution.
     
     2. Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
     
     3. Small right effusion with some underlying atelectasis, with considerable
     interval clearing of the right base alveolar opacity.

Neuro: Confused, oriented x 1. Good hand grasps; moves all extremities well although he did not seem able to lift his right leg off the bed when asked. Able to bend right knee; turns in bed fairly well. Pupils equal and briskly reactive, 2-3mm. Patient was found on floor at 2320.
He was found face-down, with a bloodied nose. He denied pain; legs were of equal length, pedal pulses palpable. Seen by in-house physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who assisted staff in lifting patient back to the bed. All bed rails had been up at the time. Patient had been given 2mg IV Haldol about one-half hour before this incident for some mild agitation and sleeplessness and had appeared to be calm. Given an additional 2 mg IV Haldol after being assisted back to bed. Wrist restraints, which had been off from the day shift, were reapplied, as was a posey vest. Patient continued to be somewhat agitated and was given IV ativan, 1 mg, which did sedate him enough to fall asleep, although he only slept < 2 hours. A computer incident form was filled out. 

CV: Remains somewhat hypertensive with BPs from 180s to 160s/80s. HR 90s to low hundreds with occasional pacs and the rare PVC. +[**12-1**] pitting edema on flanks and lower extremities. To start Atenolol and Moexipril in am. Remains on Amiodorone, now in NSR.

Resp: Received on 2L NC with sats mid to high 90s. Lung sounds diminished throughout. O2 increased to 4L NC after patient had IV ativan, as his sats had decreased to low 90s. 

GI/GU: Refused offers of gingerale, water, or applejuice. Also refused applesauce. Abdomen is soft, positive bowel sounds. Foley cath draining adequate amouns of yellow urine with much sediment in tubing. Urine culture was sent after fall. He has been incontinent of liquid stool several times this shift. 

Skin: Peri area extremely red and patient did complain of discomfort in this area. Miconozole powder applied. Transparent dressings on feet intact. Duoderm to coccyx intact. 

Lines: Multi-lumen right subclavian intact and draws well.

Plan: To be sent to floor today if bed available. ? of 1:1 if he becomes agitated again. Continiue with good pumonary toilet, monitor level of confusion. Patient is safety concern.

     Right lower lobe process with question of pleural effusion.  Patient now
     stable enough for PA and lateral view.  Follow-up for interval changes.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP view obtained with patient in upright position demonstrates
     again the diffuse densities on the bases blunting the pleural sinuses and
     obliterating the diaphragmatic contours.  The right-sided subclavian approach
     central venous line catheter is present terminating in unchanged position when

     has been extubated during the recent interval.  A lateral view is obtained
     with patient in sitting position and clearly demonstrates the-on-AP-view-
     suspected bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no conclusive evidence for
     any pulmonary parenchymal new lesion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
