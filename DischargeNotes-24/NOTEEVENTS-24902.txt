Admission Date:  [**3283-11-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**3283-12-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**3218-4-22**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Neuromedicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Difficulty breathing and difficulty
swallowing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old
woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 4358**] who was diagnosed
about one year ago when she presented with intermittent
ptosis of the right eye.  She was treated with Mestinon and
showed initial improvement, then in February, last year she
developed some slurred speech and her Mestinon dose was
increased.  In August she developed increasing facial and
bulbar weakness.  Her dose of Mestinon was increased again.
Over the month of August and September, however, her symptoms
progressively worsened until she was admitted to [**Hospital6 283**] in [**3281-9-26**] with an
inability to swallow her own secretions.  At that time she
had proximal weakness in her arms, moderate proximal weakness
in her legs and distally in her arms.  Her forced vital
capacity was about 1.1 liters and she was initially admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit.  At that time she had a urinary
tract infection which was thought possibly to have been the
precipitants of the worsening of the myasthenia.  The urinary
tract infection was treated and she started a five day course
of intravenous immunoglobulin.  She was also started on
Prednisone 80 mg a day, and her Mestinon dose was increased.
She initially responded well and was transferred to the
Neurology Floor.  She was started on Imuran initially
although it was subsequently discontinued.  During the course
of her hospitalization, she was found to have a thymoma.  She
initially improved until the beginning of October when she
developed weakness, neck flexion and extension as well as
increasing weakness in her arms, also her negative
respiratory force dropped to about -40.  She was started on
Cellcept at that point and started on plasmapheresis.  She
initially did well in the unit and was transferred back to
the regular Neurology Floor.  She continued to do quite well
and ended up undergoing a thymectomy which she tolerated
fairly well, however, postoperatively she had bilateral chest
tubes with some mild pleural effusions and continued to
complain of some shortness of breath.  Her shortness of
breath gradually improved after the chest tubes were removed
and she was discharged to home.  However, at home, the
patient noticed that she continued to have some shortness of
breath and went to [**Hospital 6297**] Hospital where she was thought to
have a right lower lobe pneumonia.  At that time she had no
fever, no sputum, and no chest pain.  She was started on
Ceftriaxone.  She remained stable there initially but then
began to have difficulty swallowing her own secretions.
After several days she was transferred to [**Hospital6 283**] for further evaluation.  Upon
evaluation here she was initially admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit.  Her forced vital capacity was 1.2 liters.  She
was continued on steroids, Mestinon and Ceftriaxone.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 4358**] as above.  2.
Status post thymectomy several weeks ago.  3.  Hypertension.
4.  Mild steroid-induced glucose intolerance.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Mestinon 60 mg p.o. q. day;
Prednisone 60 mg p.o. q. day; Ceftriaxone 1 gm q. day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not use tobacco or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination on admission she was
mildly distressed due to inability to handle her secretions.
She was afebrile.  Heartrate was 88 and regular.  Her blood
pressure was 164/100.  Her oxygen saturation was 99% on room
air.  On general examination she was normocephalic,
atraumatic with moist mucous membranes.  Neck was supple.
However, her neck strength was somewhat reduced on flexion
and extension.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heartsounds were regular rate and rhythm with
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was
soft, obese, nontender.  Neurologically mental status
revealed she was awake, alert and oriented.  Her attention
was good.  She had some mild dysarthria.  Long and shortterm
memory, intact.  Cranial nerve examination, her pupils were
round, reactive to light and symmetrically 4 mm to 2 mm
bilaterally.  There was no relative afferent pupillary
defect.  She had ptosis on sustained upgaze.  Her visual
fields were full.  Extraocular movements were full.  Her
facial sensation was intact.  She had bilateral eye closure
weakness.  Palate elevated symmetrically on both sides, she
can protrude the tongue with good resistance in both cheeks.
Sternocleidomastoids were full strength bilaterally.  On
motor examination her overall tone was normal.  She had
symmetrical proximal muscle weakness in both the deltoids and
both iliopsoas, around 4 out of 5.  She also had fatigable
triceps weakness with minimal exercise bilaterally.  Her
sensation was grossly intact to light touch throughout.
Reflexes were all symmetric and present.  Her plantar
responses were flexor.  Coordination to
finger-to-nose-to-finger was within normal limits considering
her mild proximal muscle weakness bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her initial chest x-ray showed a possible
right lower lobe pneumonia.  Her negative respiratory force
was -30, her forced vital capacity was 1.2 liters.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 65 year old woman with a
history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 4358**], ten days status post thymectomy
presenting with worsening dysarthria and difficulty handling
secretions as well as some shortness of breath.  She was
admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit over night.
However, she remained stable and did not need to be
intubated.  She was transferred to the floor the next day.
She was treated with five plasmapheresis treatments every
other day which she tolerated well.  She was continued on
intravenous Mestinon, intravenous medications initially
because she had difficulty swallowing.  However, she
eventually began to respond to the plasmapheresis and was
able to tolerate p.o. medications.  She continued on
Prednisone 80 mg p.o. q. day.  She was restarted on the
Cellcept at 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.  She continued on Mestinon 30
mg p.o. q. 4 hours and she continued to improve.  During her
admission she continued to have mild ptosis on prolonged
upgaze of over 60 seconds.  At the time of admission she also
continued to have mild fatigable triceps weakness after
approximately 30 to 45 seconds of exercise, however, her
shortness of breath had improved.  Her dysarthria and
dysphagia had essentially completely resolved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.  Her negative respiratory force
was -80, her vital capacity was 1.6 liters.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 80 mg p.o. q. day
2.  Cellcept 1 gm p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Mestinon 30 mg p.o. q. 4 hours

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is going to follow up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 28**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from the Neuromuscular Clinic.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 4358**]
2.  Mild steroid-induced glucose intolerance
3.  Hypertension

NPN

Neuro:  A&O, early this am pt with some slurring, slight eye droop, strong hand grasps, strong legs, [**Doctor First Name **] could push down her arms when they were in a [**Doctor First Name **] flap position.  She was started on prednisone, mestinon conts, by this afternoon her speech was much more slurred, R eye very droopy (almost closed), NIF 36, vital capacity 1.2 (from 9 am of a NIF of 60 and vit cap 2.4).  Pt was told that her symptoms may get worse over the next 4 days due to the prenisone but then start to get better.  Pt given test dose of IVIG which she tolerated well, an hour after it was given her speech was much less slurred, R eye much less droopy, pt is presently receiving her full dose.

CV:  VSS, receiving hr cardiac meds

Resp:  LS with some wheezes this am, cleared this afternoon, NIF and vital capacity worse this afternoon, it may be improved this evening considering that her other neuro findings have improved since the IVIG was started.

GI:  NPO except pills, tolerating water with her pills - no coughing or choking, she was seen by the speech/swallowing nurse and she felt that the was having some problems swallowing water (coughing).  She recommended that we add a very small amount of Thick-it to some juice when giving her pills.  Pt to go down for a swallowing study tomorrow morning, if she is unable to swallow she will need a feeding tube, probably just a NGT until her symptoms improve.

GU:  Urinating, using the bed pan, she has some spotting - she thinks that it is vaginal (her u/a was neg for blood), team is aware, this may be worked up as an out patient

     INDICATION:  Recovering from myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**] crisis.
     
     Real-time video fluoroscopy was provided for speech pathology who performed
     modified barium swallow examination.  Swallows were observed with pudding
     consistency, nectar consistency, and thin barium consistency.  There was early
     transport of the contrast bolus combined with a small loss of bolus control
     resulting in premature spill over.  There is delayed initiation of the swallow
     and mildly decreased laryngeal elevation.  Penetration without aspiration was
     seen with all liquid consistencies.  There is significant residue following
     the swallow.  The patient had difficulty with chewing and needed to augment
     jaw strength with her hand.  A 13 mm barium tablet got stuck in the vallecula
     on attempted swallows.  A 6-8 mm half barium pill was swallowed with hold up
     in the vallecula.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Premature spill over, decreased laryngeal elevation and delayed initiation
     of swallows resulting in penetration but not aspiration with liquid
     consistencies.
     
     Please refer to the written note by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2844**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2845**] of speech pathology,

     CT THORAX [**3283-10-23**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**].  Evaluate for possible thymoma.
     
     Helical CT of the thorax performed following intravenous administration of 100
     cc of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was administered at patient request.  Images
     were acquired with 5 mm collimation and reconstructed at 5 mm intervals.
     
     Assessment of the soft tissue structures of the thorax reveals a small oval
     shaped soft tissue density within the anterior mediastinum to the left of
     midline, measuring approximately 15 mm x 8 mm in diameter.  In a patient with
     myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**], this is highly suggestive of a thymoma.  The heart is upper
     limits of normal in size.  No pericardial effusion or pleural effusion is
     identified.  There is no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
     
     Imaging of the upper portion of the abdomen demonstrates a normal appearance
     of the adrenal glands.  Two tiny hypodensities are seen in the right kidney
     which are too small to characterize by CT.  The spleen and imaged portions of
     the pancreas are unremarkable.  The imaged portion of the liver demonstrates
     relative low attenuation possibly representing fatty infiltration.  No
     suspicious focal lesions are seen within the liver.
     
     Assessment of the lungs demonstrates dependent densities most likely
     representing dependent atelectasis.  A wedge-shaped area of opacity is seen
     peripherally in the left lower lobe with adjacent parenchymal band-like
     opacity noted.  A similar band-like opacity is seen at the right lung base
     inferiorly.  No centrally obstructing endobronchial lesions are observed.
     
     Skeletal structures of the thorax demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic
     foci within the skeletal structures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Oval shaped 15 mm x 8 mm diameter soft tissue density anterior mediastinal
     mass located  to the left of midline just anterior to the main pulmonary
     artery. In a patient with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**], this is highly suspicious for a
     small thymoma.
     2.  Band-like areas of opacity in both lower lobes as well as a focal
     peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the left lower lobe.  These findings most
     likely represent areas of atelectasis.  Pulmonary infarction is an additional
     consideration for the left lower lobe wedge-shaped opacity in the appropriate
     clinical setting.  No central pulmonary emboli are identified, but CT
                                                                 (Over)

     the attending radiologist, was present for the entire procedure. The exam was
     reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**].
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient is placed supine on the angiographic table and the
     right neck was prepped in standard sterile fashion.  Using ultrasound
     guidance, the right internal jugular vein was identified and accessed with a
     21 gauge needle from the micropuncture kit.  A .018 wire was placed and then a
     4 French sheath was placed over the wire.  A .035 wire was then placed with
     tip extending into the inferior vena cava.  A 10 French dilator was then used
     to dilate the tract.  Then, a 12 French triple lumewn catheter was placed.
     Fluoroscopy confirmed that the tip was at the RA/SVC junction.  The site was
     closed with 0 prolene sutures.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Local anesthesia was obtained with 1% lidocaine.  No contrast
     was administered.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 12 French triple lumen pheresis
     catheter with tip at the RA/SVC junction.  This catheter is ready for use.

     An 8 French [**Location (un) 2167**]-[**Doctor First Name 1533**] feeding tube was inserted through the right nare
     into the esophagus and passed into the stomach.  There was difficulty
     advancing past the fundus and so a small amount of Gastrografin was injected
     into the tube lumen.  This Gastrografin refluxed into the esophagus and
     remained in this position for several minutes despite angulation of the
     fluoroscopy table with the head superior.  A few disordered peristaltic waves
     were seen.  Eventually contrast passed into the stomach.  The tube was

     HISTORY:  65 y/o woman with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**], evaluate thickness of
     endometrial stripe and assess for masses.
     
     FINDINGS:  The external contour of the uterus is normal in appearance with no
     fibroids seen.  However, the endometrium is abnormal measuring up to 1 cm in
     thickness in an eccentric fashion along one side.  The endometrium is
     heterogeneous in echotexture with several regions of anechoic signal
     consistent with fluid.
     
     The left ovary is difficult to visualize.  The right ovary is visualized and
     normal in appearance.
     
     No free fluid is seen in either the pouch of [**Location (un) 7288**] or [**Location (un) 1128**] pouch.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Thickened endometrial stripe which is eccentrically thickened up to 1 cm in
     size. This is an abnormal finding for a postmenopausal patient and should be

     Radiologist, was present and supervising. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**] reviewed the case. 
     
     PROCEDURE:  Informed and signed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed
     supine on the angiography table and the right neck was prepped in sterile
     fashion.  After infiltrating the subcutaneous tissues with 1% lidocaine, the
     right internal jugular vein was accessed with a 19-gauge needle.  However, a
     wire could not be advanced through the right internal jugular vein.  A small
     amount of Optiray was administered which suggests central venous obstruction.
     An MRV or venogram could be considered for a more definitive diagnosis.
     
     The left upper neck was then prepped in sterile fashion and subcutaneous
     tissues infiltrated with 1% lidocaine.  The left internal jugular vein was
     then accessed and a wire was easily passed into the superior vena cava.  After
     serial dilation, a 14-French pheresis catheter was then passed with tip at the
     SVC/RA junction.  A chest x-ray was obtained to confirm placement.  The
     catheter was then sutured to the skin with 0 Prolene suture.  There were no
     immediate complications.

      65 year old woman with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**]; s/p thymectomy 2 weeks ago
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      65 yo with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**] requires line placement for plasma pheresis.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**], status post thymectomy two weeks
     ago.  Requires line placement for plasmapheresis.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2798**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 894**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 894**], the Attending
     Radiologist, was present and supervising. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**] reviewed the case. 
     
     PROCEDURE:  Informed and signed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed
     supine on the angiography table and the right neck was prepped in sterile
     fashion.  After infiltrating the subcutaneous tissues with 1% lidocaine, the
     right internal jugular vein was accessed with a 19-gauge needle.  However, a
     wire could not be advanced through the right internal jugular vein.  A small
     amount of Optiray was administered which suggests central venous obstruction.
     An MRV or venogram could be considered for a more definitive diagnosis.
     
     The left upper neck was then prepped in sterile fashion and subcutaneous
     tissues infiltrated with 1% lidocaine.  The left internal jugular vein was
     then accessed and a wire was easily passed into the superior vena cava.  After
     serial dilation, a 14-French pheresis catheter was then passed with tip at the
     SVC/RA junction.  A chest x-ray was obtained to confirm placement.  The
     catheter was then sutured to the skin with 0 Prolene suture.  There were no
     immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Findings suggestive of a central venous obstruction on the right as
     described above.  An MRV or venogram could be considered for more definitive
     diagnosis.
     
     2) Successful placement of a 20-cm, 14-French pheresis catheter via the left
     internal jugular vein with tip at the cavoatrial junction.  The line is ready
     for use.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen were obtained with
     intravenous contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc of Optiray were administered at the patient's request and
     without complication.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Linear markings at the lung
     bases are consistent with atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions.  Small
     linear densities along the gallbladder wall may reflect asymmetric
     enhancement. There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The
     liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are normal in appearance.
     A tiny low attenuation lesion within the upper right kidney is probably a
     cyst.  No free air, free fluid or adenopathy is seen.  The proximal small
     bowel opacifies normally with contrast.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The sigmoid colon, rectum, uterus
     and bladder are normal.  There is no free fluid or adenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No destructive lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION: Linear calcific densities along the gallbladder wall may reflect
     asymmetric enhancement, most likely due to adenomyomatosis, or less probably
     densities from mural calcification.  Ultrasound would be helpful in excluding
     porcelain gallbladder.
     
     No evidence of cholecystitis. No other abnormalities identified within the
     abdomen or pelvis.

     jugular vein and a micropuncture wire was inserted into the SVC right atrial
     junction.  The needle was exchanged for a sheath.  A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was made
     with a scalpel prior to this.  A .035 guidewire was passed into the right
     atrium and a dilator and then subsequently a 7 French catheter was placed to
     the right atrial junction with the SVC and inserted to its hub measuring
     approximately 15 cm.  This was sutured in place with 0 Prolene suture in two
     locations.  1% lidocaine was infiltrated to a total of approximately 9 cc
     throughout the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  A final chest
     X-ray was taken revealing the tip of the catheter in the right atrial SVC
     junction.
     
     The attending is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**].  The procedure is also performed by Dr.

     HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple MR images from the lung bases through the kidneys were
     obtained utilizing the following sequences:  Axial T1 weighted in and out of
     phase images, axial HASTE images, 2D time of flight images, thick slab heavily
     weighted T2 images, and VIBE images prior to and following the IV
     administration of Gadolinium.  Three Dimensional reconstructions were
     generated on an image processing work station.
     
     COMPARISON is made to the most recent ultrasound examination  of the right
     upper quadrant dated [**3284-8-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     ABDOMEN:  The liver is normal in size, contour and signal characteristics.  No
     hepatic mass lesion is identified.  There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic
     biliary  ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is normally distended and its wall
     is not thickened.  There is a dominant gallstone within the gallbladder lumen,
     measuring 3.3 cm.  Innumerable tiny gallstones are seen dependantly within the
     gallbladder as well.  The common bile duct is normal in wall thickness without
     evidence of intraluminal filling defect. Several tiny thin-walled, high T2
     signal, non-enhancing masses are seen within the liver representing benign
     hepatic cysts.
     
     The pancreas enhances homogeneously without evidence of peripancreatic fluid
     collection.  The pancreatic duct is not dilated.  The spleen and adrenal
     glands appear unremarkable.
     
     The kidneys are normal in location, size, access and contour.  Several tiny
     thin-walled, high T2 signal masses are seen within both kidneys, representing
     tiny benign simple cysts.  There is no hydronephrosis, bilaterally.
     
     No enlarged regional lymph nodes are identified.  There is no ascites.

     HISTORY:  Sixty-six year old female with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**], on Prednisone, who 
     presents weakness and elevated LFTs.
     
     INTERPRETATION:  Serial images over the abdomen show normal uptake of tracer 
     into the hepatic parenchyma, although there is abnormal retention of activity. 
     There is delayed visualization of the gallbladder, which appeared following the
     initial 60 minutes.  Note was made of small bowel activity in 20 minutes.  In
     the following 60-90 minutes, there is identification of the gallbladder, which
     is confirmed by a lateral view.
     
     The above findings are consistent with no evidence of cholecystitis.  There is
     delayed hepatic clearance suggesting dysfunction.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evidence of intracranial stenosis                                               
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3620**].  Vertiginous symptoms.  Assess for
     intracranial vascular disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted brain imaging was obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  The diffusion weighted images are normal.  However, there are a
     several areas of elevated T2 signal within the white matter of both cerebral
     hemispheres.  The largest lesion is within the posterior aspect of the right
     insula. It is approximately triangular in shape, with linear dimensions of
     roughly 1.5 cm on its longest side.  There is no associated enhancement with
     gadolinium. The etiology for the finding most likely includes infarction, with
     post inflammatory residua being less likely.  No mass effect or hydrocephalus
     iks seen . There is a 1 cm cystic appearing lesion within the left parotid
     gland on the most caudal axial section, and therefore the true size of the
     lesion may not be completely correctly estimated.  There is a fluid level in
     the cyst, which could represent blood or other proteinaceous material as it
     is T2 hypointense. No definite enhancement of gadolinium is appreciated.  This
     lack of enhancement would argue against a neoplastic etiology.  However, this
     diagnostic possibility is not completely excluded. The major vascular flow
     patterns appear preserved.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Multiple areas of signal abnormality within the brain as
     described above.
     
     MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Three-dimensional time of flight imaging with multiplanar
     reconstructions.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study appears within normal limits. The A2 segments of both
     anterior cerebral arteries derive their blood supply from the left carotid
     circulation.

     meningitis and hepatitis.  Requires IV antibiotics.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 7396**] was taken to the angiography suite on
     [**3284-9-6**] where her right arm was prepped and draped in standard sterile
     fashion.  The right brachial vein was identified using ultrasound.  After
     administration of 1% lidocaine to the subcutaneous tissue an 18 gauge needle
     was advanced into the brachial vein under ultrasound guidance.  A guidewire
     was then advanced through the needle into the axillary vein and the needle was
     exchanged for a peel-away sheath after extension of the incision with a
     scalpel.  The short guidewire was then exchanged for a measuring guidewire
     which was advanced to the desired location in the distal superior vena cava.
     The double lumen PICC line was then measured accordingly to 32 cm and cut at
     that length.  The PICC line was then advanced over the guidewire through the
     peel-away sheath.  The sheath was removed as was the guidewire.  The PICC line
     was then flushed and secured into position.  Final X-ray demonstrated the tip
     of the PICC line to be in the superior vena cava.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure well and there were no immediate post procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right double lumen PICC placement with tip in distal superior
     vena cava.  The line is ready for use.

     FINDINGS:  The previously seen right-sided PICC line terminates with tip in

     pulmonary vasculature appear within normal limits without cardiac failure.
     There is stable linear atelectasis at the left base.  On the PA view, there is
     blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  However, on the lateral view, there
     is no evidence of left-sided pleural effusion with slight blunting of the
     right costophrenic angle indicating possible tiny right pleural effusion.  The
     visualized osseous structures are unchanged.  Additional note is made of
     changes of prior cardiac surgery with median sternotomy wires.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Stable linear atelectasis at the left base.
     
     2.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle seen on the PA view likely
     represents a pleural adhesion rather than a pleural effusion, as the posterior
     costophrenic sulcus is clear on the lateral view.  If clinical indication
     warrants, a left lateral decubitus film would be more sensitive for
     identifying a small left pleural effusion.
     
     3.  Tiny right pleural effusion.
