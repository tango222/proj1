                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images were obtained from the lung bases to the
     proximal femurs with oral and intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is minimal atelectasis at the left
     lung base.  Otherwise, the lung fields are clear.  The visualized heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
     The liver contains multiple low-density foci many of which are too small to
     characterize.  Within the anterior left lobe of the liver is a 3.7 x 2.5 cm
     low-density focus, which likely represents a simple liver cyst.  The
     gallbladder is distended and likely contains stones or sludge.  There is no
     evidence for gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, or inflammatory
     stranding to suggest cholecystitis.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  The left kidney contains multiple low-density rounded foci,
     which are too small to characterize.  Off the lower pole is a 3.1 x 3.4 cm
     rounded low-density exophytic focus likely a simple renal cyst.  The left
     kidney contains multiple rounded low-density cysts, the largest in the mid
     pole measuring 5.8 x 6.4 cm, likely a simple renal cyst.  Both kidneys enhance
     symmetrically and excrete contrast normally.  There is no evidence for
     hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  The stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of
     small bowel are unremarkable.  The intra-abdominal large bowel demonstrates
     diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.  There is no free air or
     free fluid.  There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum is unremarkable.  The sigmoid
     colon demonstrates diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.  The
     distal ureters are unremarkable.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley
     catheter.  The seminal vesicles and prostate are unremarkable.  The
     intrapelvic loops of small bowel are normal.  There is no pathologically
     enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  There is no free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracolumbar spine.
     
     CT REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial
     findings.  Value grade1.

     2.  No evidence for intra-abdominal or intrapelvic bowel abnormality including
     colitis or diverticulitis.
     3.  Diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
     4.  Low-density lesions within the liver and bilateral kidneys likely
     representing cysts.  These foci could be definitively characterized with
     ultrasound if clinically indicated.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images were obtained from the lung bases to the
     proximal femurs with oral and intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is minimal atelectasis at the left
     lung base.  Otherwise, the lung fields are clear.  The visualized heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
     The liver contains multiple low-density foci many of which are too small to
     characterize.  Within the anterior left lobe of the liver is a 3.7 x 2.5 cm
     low-density focus, which likely represents a simple liver cyst.  The
     gallbladder is distended and likely contains stones or sludge.  There is no
     evidence for gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, or inflammatory
     stranding to suggest cholecystitis.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  The left kidney contains multiple low-density rounded foci,
     which are too small to characterize.  Off the lower pole is a 3.1 x 3.4 cm
     rounded low-density exophytic focus likely a simple renal cyst.  The left
     kidney contains multiple rounded low-density cysts, the largest in the mid
     pole measuring 5.8 x 6.4 cm, likely a simple renal cyst.  Both kidneys enhance
     symmetrically and excrete contrast normally.  There is no evidence for
     hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  The stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of
     small bowel are unremarkable.  The intra-abdominal large bowel demonstrates
     diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.  There is no free air or
     free fluid.  There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum is unremarkable.  The sigmoid
     colon demonstrates diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.  The
     distal ureters are unremarkable.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley
     catheter.  The seminal vesicles and prostate are unremarkable.  The
     intrapelvic loops of small bowel are normal.  There is no pathologically
     enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  There is no free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracolumbar spine.

     Comparison is made to prior chest x-ray dated [**2799-2-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
     
     The heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable in configuration.  The
     aorta is unfolded. There is slight increased density projecting in the right
     lower lung zone, which likely reflects atelectasis.  The lungs otherwise
     demonstrate no confluent areas of consolidation or effusion. There is stable
     elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The osseous structures are not
     significantly changed with degenerative changes noted in the mid-to-lower
     thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No overt evidence of pneumonia or CHF.  Probable atelectasis at
     the right base.

     FINDINGS:  Three views of the right elbow were obtained.  There is no evidence
     of fracture or dislocation.  Calcific densities posterior to the olecranon may
     be secondary to prior trauma or calcific tendonitis of the triceps tendon.
     Extensive vascular calcifications are identified.  Soft tissue prominance
     along the dorsal elbow is identified.

     CHEST, AP AND LATERAL:  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.
     The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  Rounded
     opacity on the lateral view in the posterior inferior lung fields is likely
     secondary to summation of structures.  The lungs are otherwise clear.
     Increased AP diameter of the chest is consistent with COPD.  There are no
     pleural effusions. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No CHF or pneumonia.

     COMPARISON:  [**2801-3-20**].
     
     AP PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST:  There has been no change in the heart size or
     mediastinal contours.  Again seen is the widened thoracic aorta with
     displacement of the trachea to the right.  The lordotic position again
     exaggerates diaphragmatic elevation.  The left lateral lung is not included in
     the field of view but the visualized portion of the left base demonstrates
     improved aeration although there is persistent consolidation at this location.
     The right lung is grossly clear.  There is persistent pulmonary vascular
     engorgement consistent with a degree of volume overload.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent left base consolidation and vascular engorgement.

     INDICATION:  82-year-old with right elbow infection and malpositioned PICC.
     Patient requires PICC for IV antibiotics.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  [**Doctor Last Name 646**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 282**] [**Doctor Last Name 4**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the attending
     radiologist, was present and supervising the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The patient has existing left antecubital fossa PICC in
     place which is malpositioned, coiling within the axilla.  The patient's left
     arm was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  The existing wire was
     removed, and initially a 018 wire was passed through the PICC, but were unable
     to pass beyond the axilla.  The 018 wire was removed, and a 018 Glidewire was
     then passed through the PICC into the distal SVC.  The existing PICC was
     removed and exchanged for a 4.5-French sheath.  The Glidewire was removed, and
     the 018 wire was again reinserted.  Based on the markings on the wire, a
     length of 48 cm was deemed to be appropriate.  A new single-lumen PICC was
     trimmed to length and passed over the wire into the distal SVC under
     fluoroscopic guidance. Final fluoroscopic image demonstrates the tip to be
     within the distal SVC.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Successful exchange of existing malpositioned PICC for a new single-lumen 48-
     cm PICC with its tip in the distal SVC.  The line is ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  82-year-old with right elbow infection and malpositioned PICC.
     Patient requires PICC for IV antibiotics.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  [**Doctor Last Name 646**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 282**] [**Doctor Last Name 4**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the attending
     radiologist, was present and supervising the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The patient has existing left antecubital fossa PICC in
     place which is malpositioned, coiling within the axilla.  The patient's left
     arm was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  The existing wire was
     removed, and initially a 018 wire was passed through the PICC, but were unable
     to pass beyond the axilla.  The 018 wire was removed, and a 018 Glidewire was
     then passed through the PICC into the distal SVC.  The existing PICC was
     removed and exchanged for a 4.5-French sheath.  The Glidewire was removed, and
     the 018 wire was again reinserted.  Based on the markings on the wire, a
     length of 48 cm was deemed to be appropriate.  A new single-lumen PICC was
     trimmed to length and passed over the wire into the distal SVC under
     fluoroscopic guidance. Final fluoroscopic image demonstrates the tip to be
     within the distal SVC.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Successful exchange of existing malpositioned PICC for a new single-lumen 48-
     cm PICC with its tip in the distal SVC.  The line is ready for use.

Respiratory Care
PT remains on AC settings. Attempted PSV trial, as [**Name8 (MD) 59**] MD order.  PT was tried on 16 PS over 8 of PEEP.  PT had a sharp increase in Respiratory rate 23bpm to 35bpm, although sponatnous Tidal volumes were in adequate range of 400-500cc.  The extra PEEP was given in an attempt to raise residual volume. This manuever, however did not help in decreasing patients respiratory rate.  Pt was then returned to AC settings (total of 6 mins on PSV of 16/8).  Lung sounds- clear to asculation.  Suctioned by RN as noted.  As of this note, pt is in stable respiratory status on AC settings.  Another attempt for PSV to be tried in a few hours.
