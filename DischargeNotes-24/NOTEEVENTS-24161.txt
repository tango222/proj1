CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**3464-6-23**] 10:41 AM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval: pneumatocele 
Field of view: 36

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
30 year old man motorcycle accident known pneumatocele 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval: pneumatocele 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Motorcycle accident with pneumatocele.

COMPARISON: Chest CT from [**3464-6-18**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the 
thoracic inlet through the upper abdomen were obtained without 
intravenous contrast. Images were displayed with 5 mm and 1.25 
mm collimation.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A small hydropneumothorax 
is again demonstrated in the left hemithorax. The amount of 
hyperdense fluid within the hydropneumothorax is unchanged since 
the prior exam, but there has been interval decrease in the 
density of this complex fluid ([**Doctor Last Name **] 30), consistent with evolving 
hemothorax. Air within the apical component of the 
hydropneumothorax has nearly resolved, but there is a slightly 
increased amount of air within the basilar component. A left 
chest tube is present with the tip located posterior to the left 
upper lobe. The hyperdense bilobed pneumatocele containing an 
air- fluid level in the left lower lobe is stable in size and 
appearance from the prior exam. The ground glass opacification 
surrounding the pneumatocele in the left lower lobe has improved 
in the interval, representing resolving contusion. Improved 
aeration is present in the right lower lobe, consistent with 
improving atelectasis. Additionally, a focal cluster of tiny 
ground glass nodular opacities in the posterior right upper lobe 
may represent an area of focal subclinical aspiration. The 
airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi 
bilaterally.

A calcified right paratracheal lymph node is again demonstrated. 
No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph[**MD Number 2082**] are present. Heart, pericardium, and great vessels are 
within normal limits. There is interval decrease in the amount 
of subcutaneous emphysema within the anterior chest wall and 
soft tissues.

In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, no abnormalities are 
demonstrated.

Bone windows again demonstrate multiple contiguous displaced rib 
fractures on the left, unchanged in the interval.

IMPRESSION:

1) Stable appearance of post-traumatic left lower lobe 
pneumatocele with intraluminal hemorrhage. Resolving surrounding 
contusion.

2) Small left hemopneumothorax with slight interval increase in 
amount of air in the basilar component of the hemopneumothorax, 
but near complete resolution of air within the apical component.

3) Improving right lower lobe atelectasis.

4) Focal clustered centrilobular opacities, likely due to 
subclinical aspiration in posterior segment of the right lobe 
upper lobe.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3464-6-23**] 5:55 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval: PTX (please perform CXR at 19:00) 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
43 year old man with L pneumatocoele, L PTX s/p CT pulled. 
(please perform CXR at 19:00) 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval: PTX (please perform CXR at 19:00) 
INDICATION: 43-year-old male with left pneumatocele and left 
pneumothorax status post chest tube removal. Evaluate for 
pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: [**3464-6-22**].

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:

Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and 
unchanged. Left apical pneumothorax has decreased in size. 
Patient is status post removal of left hemithorax chest tubes. 
Left lower lung opacity corresponding with known pneumatocele 
and unchanged compared to prior. No focal opacities. Small left 
pleural effusion unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in left apical pneumothorax with tiny 
pneumothorax appreciated.
2. Unchanged loculated small left pleural effusion.
3. Unchanged left lower lobe opacity consistent with history of 
pneumatocele.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. He was intubated in the 
emergency room; a left thoracostomy tube was also placed. 
Neurosurgery was consulted because of his a small SAH identified 
on CT imaging; a CTA revealed no dissection. Repeat head imaging 
remained stable. No operative intervention warranted.

Thoracic surgery was consulted because of a pneumatocele and 
lung contusions. Serial chest radiographs performed, a chest CT 
was also performed and was stable. His chest tube was removed on 
HD #7. He will follow up in Trauma Clinic in 2 weeks for repeat 
chest xray.

Orthopedic spine surgery was consulted because of finding on CT 
imaging of his cervical spine. No surgical intervention; he will 
remain in a hard cervical collar for 2 weeks and will follow up 
with the Spine surgeon for repeat imaging of his cervical spine. 


Acute pain service was also consulted because of his rib 
fractures; he was initially a PCA for pain control and later 
changed to oral narcotics. His pain is currently controlled with 
prn Ibuprofen and Oxycodone. He will be discharged with these 
medications.

He was also evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o vertebral artery injury

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  43-year-old man status post motorcycle crash with right C5
     transverse process fracture.  Evaluate for vertebral artery injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CTA Neck from the lung apices to the skull base.  Awaiting 3-D
     reconstructions.
     
     CTA NECK:  The carotid arteries are of normal caliber without evidence of
     focal stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.  The left vertebral artery is
     dominant.  There is no evidence of dissection.
     
     There is a right C5 transverse process fracture.  There is a left third rib
     fracture.
     
     There are non-pathologically enlarged level I and level II lymph nodes.
     
     A left-sided chest tube is seen coursing medially. A left sided high
     attenuation effusion with associated atelectasis is noted.  Foci of air are
     seen adjacent to the left ribs.  Foci of pneumocephalus are seen anterior to
     the right temporal lobe.
     
     The patient is intubated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Dominant left vertebral artery with no evidence of dissection.
     2.  Right C5 transverse process fracture traversing the foramen
     transversarium.
     3.  Left third rib fracture.
     
     Awaiting 3-D reconstructions.
     
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The volume rendered images also appear normal.
     Note that the sensitivity of CTA for detecting cervical arterial dissection is
     unknown, but available evidence suggests that it is low.
     
     There is opacification of the right mastoid air cells. This finding, in
     concert with the history of trauma and intracranial air, suggests a mastoid
     fracture, although no such fracture is demonstrated on this study. 
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  43-year-old man status post motor vehicle collision with loss of
     consciousness.  Evaluate for fracture.
     
     No prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast cervical spine with multiplanar reformatted images.
     
     FINDINGS:  On sagittal images, the skull base to top of the T3 vertebrae are
     visualized.  There are no prevertebral soft tissue abnormalities.  There is a
     fracture through the right C5 transverse process, which extends across the
     foramen transversarium. No other fractures are seen.  There is anterior
     widening of the C6/7 disc interspace with no significant prevertebral soft
     tissue swelling. There is ligamentous calcification at this level.
     
     There is mild degenerative change of the cervical spine most pronounced at the
     C3/4 through C5/6 levels manifested by anterior osteophytes and endplate
     changes.
     
     CT does not provide intrathecal detail comparable to MRI.  There are no gross
     thecal sac abnormalities.
     
     There is a small left apical pneumothorax.
     
     A small focus of pneumocephalus is seen at the brain base adjacent to the
     right mastoid air cells.
     
     There are scattered level 1 and level 2 lymph nodes.  Do not meet the CT
     criteria for pathologic enlargement.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Fracture of the right C5 transverse process.  Given the proximity to the
     vertebral artery, CTA of the neck can be performed to evaluate for vertebral
     artery dissection.
     2.  Mild widening of the anterior disc space of C6/7.  No gross prevertebral
     swelling.  Flexion, extension radiographs or MRI are more sensitive in the
     evaluation of ligamentous injury.
     3.  Small left apical pneumothorax.
     4.  Small focus of pneumocephalus adjacent to the right mastoid air cells.
     5.  Degenerative changes of the cervical spine.

     INDICATION:  30-year-old man status post MVC with loss of consciousness.
     
     No prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  Punctate foci of high attenuation are seen in the right frontal
     lobe and in the sulci, concerning for intraparenchymal and subarachnoid
     hemorrhage.  Similarly, small foci of increased attenuation are present along
     the inferolateral surface of the right temporal lobe, probably indicating
     small contusions.  No brain edema is evident. There is no shift of the
     normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.  Small foci of pneumocephalus
     are seen in the right middle cranial fossa, likely related to a fracture of
     the adjacent temporal bone. There is opacification of a few superior mastoid
     air cells with no definitive evidence of fracture. There is a scalp hematoma
     posterior to the left parietal bone with scattered foci of air. An underlying
     fracture through the left parietal and left occipital bone extends down into
     the lambdoid suture.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  High-attenuation foci within the right frontal lobe cortex and sulci may
     represent intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage. There are likely
     small right temporal lobe contusions as well.
     2.  Fractues of the right temporal and left parietal and occipital bones.
     
                                                                           DFDgf

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT HEAD
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Head trauma.  Evaluation of head bleed since the prior
     scan.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made with CT head performed earlier on the same day.
     
     The previously described punctate foci of hyperattenuation at the right
     frontal lobe are again noted, compatible with acute blood products (series 4A,
     image 12 and 13).  Pockets of pneumocephalus in that region, however, have
     resolved.  The pockets of pneumocephalus seen previously, now accumulates at
     the nondependent portion of the right middle cranial cavity (series 4A, image
     11).  Nondisplaced fracture at the left parietal and occipital bones are again
     noted, unchanged in appearance.  There is now further opacification of the
     right mastoid air cells, and underlying nondisplaced fracture is suspected,
     although not clearly identified in this study.
     
     There is diffuse opacifications of the ethmoidal air cells and sphenoid sinus,
     and an endotracheal tube is seen in situ There is no hydrocephalus,
     displacement of the normally midline structures, or effacement of the basal
     cisterns.  Scalp hematoma posteriorly with overlying skin staples are again
     noted.
     
     A tiny focus of hyperdensity is again present at the interpedunculated cistern
     (image 14) - likely to represent a small amount of acute blood.  This remains
     unchanged in appearance.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Little interval change since the prior head CT performed earlier
     on the same day.  Imaging features suggestive of an open occult fracture at
     the right petrous temporal bone, and nondisplaced fracture at the left
     parietal/occipital bones are again noted.  Foci of acute intraparenchymal
     hemorrhage at the right frontal lobe are present, largely unchanged.  Pockets
     of pneumocephalus now reaccumulates at the nondependent portion of the right
     middle cranial fossa.

     INDICATION:  43-year-old man status post motorcycle crash with right C5
     transverse process fracture.  Evaluate for vertebral artery injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CTA Neck from the lung apices to the skull base.  Awaiting 3-D
     reconstructions.
     
     CTA NECK:  The carotid arteries are of normal caliber without evidence of
     focal stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.  The left vertebral artery is
     dominant.  There is no evidence of dissection.
     
     There is a right C5 transverse process fracture.  There is a left third rib
     fracture.
     
     There are non-pathologically enlarged level I and level II lymph nodes.
     
     A left-sided chest tube is seen coursing medially. A left sided high
     attenuation effusion with associated atelectasis is noted.  Foci of air are
     seen adjacent to the left ribs.  Foci of pneumocephalus are seen anterior to
     the right temporal lobe.
     
     The patient is intubated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Dominant left vertebral artery with no evidence of dissection.
     2.  Right C5 transverse process fracture traversing the foramen
     transversarium.
     3.  Left third rib fracture.
     
     Awaiting 3-D reconstructions.
     
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The volume rendered images also appear normal.
     Note that the sensitivity of CTA for detecting cervical arterial dissection is
     unknown, but available evidence suggests that it is low.
     
     There is opacification of the right mastoid air cells. This finding, in
     concert with the history of trauma and intracranial air, suggests a mastoid
     fracture, although no such fracture is demonstrated on this study.

     hemoptysis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the chest pre- and post-IV contrast.  90 cc of

     COMPARISON:  [**3464-6-16**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST PRE- AND POST-IV CONTRAST:  There is a small left
     pneumothorax, which is slightly increased compared to the prior study. 
     Subcutaneous air is seen in the anterior left chest wall soft tissues as well
     as a small amount of pneumomediastinum is present.  Opacities seen in the left
     upper lobe have improved compared to the prior study.  However, a bilobed
     hemorrhagic pneumatocele in the left lower lobe has increased in size.  It now
     measures approximately 4.0 x 6.3 in greatest dimension, previously 2.2 x 5.4
     cm.  A second lobe of the lesion measures 3.5 x 3.7 cm, previously 3.0 x 2.8
     cm.  Ground-glass attenuation around this lesion consistent with parenchymal
     hemorrhage is unchanged.  Atelectatic changes persist at the left lung base. 
     There is increased consolidation in the right lower lobe.  A high-attenuation
     pleural effusion persists in the left hemithorax, though decreased in size
     from the prior study.
     
     Bronchi are patent to the segmental level.  Study is somewhat limited due to
     streak and motion artifact, but the heart, pericardium, and great vessels
     appear unremarkable.  No obvious area of extravasation of contrast is seen. 
     There is no significant lymphadenopathy.  A left-sided chest tube remains in
     place with its tip terminating in the posterior apex.  Numerous left-sided rib
     fractures are stable.
     
     Liver is fatty.  The remainder of the visualized upper abdomen is
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Increase in size of a bilobed hemorrhagic pneumatocele seen in the left
     lower lobe.  Hemothorax is also present, but the extent appears somewhat less.
     
     2.  Ground-glass opacity in the left lower lobe around the hemorrhagic
     pneumatocele represents residual parenchymal hemorrhage.  The left upper lobe

     there is now a basilar component which was not visualized previously.
     Loculated left pleural fluid collection most prominent laterally adjacent to
     acute contiguous left sided rib fractures are again demonstrated.  There is
     improving parenchymal opacity in the left lower lobe, likely due to resolving

     CHEST, TWO VIEWS
     
     INDICATION:  43-year-old man with left pneumothorax.
     
     COMMENTS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are reviewed, and compared
     with the previous study of yesterday.
     
     The left chest tube remains in place.  There is slight increase in left apical
     pneumothorax (10%).  There is continued markedly loculated left small pleural
     effusion.  There is also small right pleural effusion.  Again note is made of
     left lower lobe opacity, which appears slightly decreased in size consistent
     with patient's history of pneumatocele.
     
     The heart is normal in size.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Slightly increased left apical pneumothorax (10%).
     2.  Continued loculated small left pleural effusion.
     3.  Slightly decreasing left lower lobe opacity, as described above.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Motorcycle accident with pneumatocele.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT from [**3464-6-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the thoracic inlet
     through the upper abdomen were obtained without intravenous contrast.  Images
     were displayed with 5 mm and 1.25 mm collimation.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  A small hydropneumothorax is again
     demonstrated in the left hemithorax.  The amount of hyperdense fluid within
     the hydropneumothorax is unchanged since the prior exam, but there has been
     interval decrease in the density of this complex fluid ([**Doctor Last Name 74**] 30), consistent
     with evolving hemothorax. Air within the apical component of the
     hydropneumothorax has nearly resolved, but there is a slightly increased
     amount of air within the basilar component. A left chest tube is present with
     the tip located posterior to the left upper lobe.  The hyperdense bilobed
     pneumatocele containing an air- fluid level in the left lower lobe is stable
     in size and appearance from the prior exam.  The ground glass opacification
     surrounding the pneumatocele in the left lower lobe has improved in the
     interval, representing resolving contusion.  Improved aeration is present in
     the right lower lobe, consistent with improving atelectasis. Additionally, a
     focal cluster of tiny ground glass nodular opacities in the posterior right
     upper lobe may represent an area of focal subclinical aspiration.  The airways
     are patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     A calcified right paratracheal lymph node is again demonstrated.  No
     pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph nodes are
     present.  Heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within normal limits.
     There is interval decrease in the amount of subcutaneous emphysema within the
     anterior chest wall and soft tissues.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, no abnormalities are demonstrated.
     
     Bone windows again demonstrate multiple contiguous displaced rib fractures on
     the left, unchanged in the interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Stable appearance of post-traumatic left lower lobe pneumatocele with
     intraluminal hemorrhage.  Resolving surrounding contusion.
                                                                 (Over)

     2)  Small left hemopneumothorax with slight interval increase in amount of air

     3)  Improving right lower lobe atelectasis.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM [**7-5**]
     
     HISTORY:  Left pneumatocele.  Chest tube pulled.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**6-22**] and 25:
     
     Left pneumothorax has resolved, but small left pleural effusion has increased
     and extending to the posterior aspect of the fluid-filled, presumably
     hemorrhagic, pneumatocele in the left lower lobe.  More atelectasis medial to
     the pneumatocele explains the obliteration of the margins of the descending
     thoracic aorta and paraspinal mediastinal reflection.  The right lateral
     costal pleural sulcus is shallow, as before, but the posterior reflection is
     entirely normal and I doubt that any right pleural effusion is present.  Heart
     is normal size and mediastinum is midline.

     AP AND LATERAL PLUS FLEXION/EXTENSION LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CERVICAL SPINE DONE
     UPRIGHT.  There is slight lordotic angulation of the spine in lateral
     projection centered at C6, but normal vertebral body alignment.  There is
     slight disc narrowing and associated osteophytes at all levels from C3 through
     C6.  The spine is imaged to the T1-2 disc in lateral projection.  No abnormal
     motion on flexion/extension.  No fracture or prevertebral soft tissue swelling
     identified.  Lung apices clear.  This patient has no previous comparison
     radiographs of cervical spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Degenerative changes and disc narrowing mid cervical spine.  No
     fracture identified and normal motion.
