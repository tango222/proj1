Admission Date:  [**2654-1-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2654-2-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2565-5-24**]     Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA

ADDENDUM:

The patient remained in the hospital and was unable to
improve from a cardiopulmonary status.  He had continued
rapid ventricular response to his atrial fibrillation as well
as persistent tachypnea and respiratory distress.  The
patient was managed on the floor and ultimately transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit for several days during his final
days here at the hospital.  During that time, he had his rate
well controlled with beta blockade.  He was ruled out for
myocardial infarction.  He was diuresed p.r.n. with Lasix,
however, his respiratory status continued to worsen and he
had persistent respiratory failure.

The family had already decided under the guidance of the
daughter who is the primary caregiver for the patient as well
as medical care proxy that he be made DNR/DNI.  This was
decided with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] some time over the days of
[**2654-2-2**], and [**2654-2-3**].  After the patient was made DNR/DNI,
he persisted and stayed in the Intensive Care Unit for
continued pulmonary toiletting and pulmonary care.  His
mental status really never improved. Ultimately, he became
progressively more tachypneic.

It was noted prior to his admission to the Intensive Care
Unit and prior to his final days of admission, he did have a
complication with his percutaneous enteral gastrostomy site.
There was gross purulent exudate and he had a local
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site infection.  This was
debrided and drained adequately.  The percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy had actually been removed and he had a
gastrocutaneous fistula that subsequently closed on its own.
He never had any evidence of intra-abdominal sepsis.  He had
TPN for his nutritional support in his final days.  Really
the demise of this patient was ultimately secondary to
respiratory failure thought to be secondary to failure to
thrive, malnutrition secondary to poor p.o. intake and
accessibility of his gastrointestinal tract, status post
failed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube as well as
his poor mental status secondary to his head trauma from his
fall.

He had inability to protect his airway and given his advanced
age and relatively poor respiratory status at baseline and
sedentary nature and inability to participate in aggressive
pulmonary toiletting, it ultimately caught up to him and
given his DNR/DNI status, we were unable to perform any
heroic measures to sustain him.  Ultimately, the patient's
family decided to make him comfort measures only.  Under
discussion that was held with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the covering
trauma attending, the patient was made comfort measures only
in the afternoon of [**2654-2-6**].

Shortly thereafter, by 7:45 p.m. on the evening of [**2654-2-6**],
the patient was declared dead by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 597**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5016**].  The
patient's family was in attendance and were well aware and
actually handled this ordeal quite well.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the
covering trauma attending, was thereafter notified.
Appropriate paperwork including death certificate and
notification of the medical examiner was made.  Ultimately,
the patient's postmortem was declined by the medical examiner
and the remainder of his disposition will be held to the
funeral director and family to coordinate.

The patient's underlying cause of death is secondary to
respiratory failure thought to be secondary to severe
atelectasis and inability to clear secretions due to
oropharyngeal dysfunction likely secondary to advanced age
likely prior cerebrovascular accidents in the setting of a
new head trauma. Other diagnoses include coronary artery
disease, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response,
likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and failure to
thrive.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     CT OF CERVICAL SPINE:
     
     HISTORY:  Recent fall.  Neck pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast imaging of the entire cervical spine was
     obtained with multiplanar reconstructions.
     
     FINDINGS:   There is no obvious fracture or abnormal alignment of the
     component vertebrae.  However, there is very extensive ossification of the
     posterior longitudinal ligament which likely causes moderate spinal cord
     compression, extending from C2 through C4.  There are multiple large anterior
     bridging osteophyes within the cervical spine as well as a fairly solid
     anterior longitudinal ligament fusion at the cervicothoracic junction.   The
     caudal extent of that fusion cannot be assessed on these studies.  Extensive
     uncovertebral spurs cause multilevel neural foraminal encroachment.
     
     Finally, the images raise the question of a 2 cm mass within the right lobe of
     the thyroid gland.  Further evaluation of this finding with sonography would
     be helpful.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No sign of a fracture.  Extensive ossificaiton of the posterior
     longitudinal ligament,  and other degenerative findings as noted above. Right
     thyroid mass.

     INDICATION:   Fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases through
     the femoral heads after administration of 150 cc of Optiray, as per the trauma
     protocol.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is right-sided pleural effusion and
     associated right basilar atelectasis.  There is low-attenuation abutting the
     pleura on the right which may represent a lipoma or extrapleural fat.
     
     There are several tiny, low-attenuation foci in the liver which are too small
     to fully characterize but may represent simple hepatic cysts.  The gallbladder
     is not visualized.  The spleen has an unremarkable appearance.  The pancreas
     and right adrenal appear normal.  There is a 2.2 x 1.5 cm lesion arising from
     the left adrenal which appears to contain fat and may represent a myelolipoma.
     Both kidneys are atrophic. There are multiple low-attenuation lesions of both
     kidneys which likely represent simple renal cysts.  There is a high-
     attenuation mass lesion arising from the mid-portion of the right kidney which
     has a more concerning appearance and neoplasm cannot be excluded.  No free air
     or free fluid is identified in the abdomen.  There is no significant
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph adenopathy.  The aorta is very ectatic.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The visualized loops of large and small bowel
     are unremarkable.  A Foley catheter is in place.  There is no free air or free
     fluid in the pelvis.  There is ectasia of the iliac arteries.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes of the spine.  There is
     calcification of the L2-3 disc.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of acute intra-abdominal traumatic injury.
     2.  A 2.2 x 1.5 cm, fat containing structure arising from the left adrenal
     gland which likely represents a myelolipoma.
     3.  Multiple simple cysts in both kidneys which are atrophic.
     4.  A 2.1 x 1.5 cm enhancing lesion arising from the right kidney which is
     worrisome for renal cell carcinoma. MRI is recommended for further
     characterization.

     HISTORY:  History of intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2654-1-29**].
     
     AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The study has two AP images, both of which are
     suboptimal.  The patient is rotated to the right.  The heart size is enlarged,
     unchanged from the prior study.  There is no evidence of failure.  There is
     unfolding of the aorta.
     
     Compared to the prior study, there is improvement in the left lower lobe
     collapse/consolidation.  However, there is a possibility of a small right
     lower lobe infiltrate.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Improving left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
     2. Interval development of possible right lower lobe infiltrate.
