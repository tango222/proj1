Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 310**] 
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, cerebral SDH & SAH
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
85 yo man w/ PMH of CAD, CHF, DMII, CLL, and recent TIA who fell 
resulting in extensive SAH and SDH. Patient was walking when he 
bent forward to pick up dropped mail, lost his balance, and fell 
backwards hitting the posterior of his head on the ground. His 
son who witnessed the event states that the patient had no LOC. 
EMT was called and on arrival to OSH, he was nauseous, vomiting, 
and had blood draining from his L ear. Head CT showed extensive 
SAH and SDH and a L temporal bone fracture, and the patient was 
transfered to [**Hospital1 25**] for further management. Patient had no 
prodrome or preceeding palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, 
headaches, no recent fever or chills, and no visual changes. No 
seizure or fall history. Patient had a TIA 2 weeks ago 
characterized by slurred speech. He had been on ASA and plavix, 
but discontinued after the TIA and was switched to aggrenox.
.
The patient was admitted to neurosurgery, but due to the 
extensive bleed, there were no surgical options, so he was 
medically managed with seizure prophylaxis.  The NeuroICU course 
was c/b NSTEMI ([**2987-2-21**] CK=1338), CHF exacerbation, and desats 
into the 80's. Patient was on lasix gtt for volume overload. 
ECHO on [**2-20**] showed EF>55%, moderate diastolic dysfunction. EKG 
showed periods of SVT. Per cardiology consult, treatment options 
were limited as the pt cannot be on anti-platelet agents or 
anticoagulants due to SAH and SDH. The patient was medically 
managed w/ beta blocker, ACE I, statin, and lasix IV for CHF. 
The patient has a history of CLL and his WBC trended up from 66K 
on admission to 88K. 
 
Past Medical History:
-Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diagnosed one year ago
-Transient Ischemic Attack 2 weeks ago causing slurred speech, 
resolved without intervention
-CAD s/p stenting 10 years ago  
-DMII  
-Congestive Heart Failure  
-Hypertension

[**2987-2-20**]: Non-contrast head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive 
subarachnoid hemorrhage seen within the frontal lobes 
bilaterally, right frontal lobe, left parietal lobe. Layering 
blood also seen within the lateral ventricles.
2. Intraparenchymal contusion/hemorrhage seen within the 
anterior frontal lobes bilaterally. 3. Subdural hematoma seen in 
the frontal regions bilaterally, and tracking along the falx. 4. 
Nondisplaced fractures of the left temporal bone, with 
associated hemotympanum. 

[**2987-2-22**] Cardiac ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly 
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Grade II 
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate 
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
#Cerebral SAH/SDH: Initial head CT on [**2-20**] showed extensive SDH 
and SAH with blood in the lateral ventricles, no mid-line shift, 
left temporal bone fracture, and hemotympanum. Patient was 
admitted to neurosurgical ICU. Neurosurgery was consulted and no 
surgical intervention was indicated because of extensive nature 
of SDH and SAH and poor prognosis. Repeat head CT on [**2-21**] showed 
no significant interval change. He was started on phenytoin 
100mg po tid for seizure prophylaxis. 
.
#NSTEMI: Patient had NSTEMI on [**2-20**]. EKG showed diffuse ST 
depressions. Per cardiology, patient was not a good candidate 
for catherization because of his extensive SAH and SDH such that 
he could not be placed on anti-platlet therapy afterwards. 
Patient medically managed with B blocker, nitroglycerin, ACEI, 
and atorvastatin 80mg po daily. No anti-coagulation or 
anti-platlet therapy added. Family discussion confirmed DNR/DNI 
status and patient preference for non-invasive care. On [**2-21**], 
CK-MB elevated to 88 and troponin elevated to 2.78.  He was 
monitored on telemetry and had episodes of paroxysmal SVT to 
120's, otherwise HR well controlled to 60's. Metoprolol dose was 
increased to 50mg po bid. 
.
#SOB: Patient with desats to 70-80's on [**2987-2-23**] at night thought 
to be due to flash pulmonary edma secondary to diastolic heart 
failure and NSTEMI on [**2-20**]. Patient improved with 40mg IV lasix 
and lopressor 5mg IV. The patient's urine output was monitored 
and was good. On [**2987-2-24**] in the AM, patient had a desat to 
mid-80's, HR's 60-80's, BP 148/62. He improved with 10L O2 by 
facemask, nitropaste topically, and nebulizer. CXR did not show 
worsening compared to prior. EKG showed ST depression in 
anterolateral leads. Due to concern for aspiration and mucous 
plugging, tube feeds were held and chest PT and deep suctioning 
were performed with improved respiratory status. Later that day, 
the patient had increased SOB, somnelence, tachycardia, and was 
febrile. Medical team met with the family to discuss care 
options of MICU with intubation or CMO given that patient was 
DNI. During family discussion, patient began agonal breathing 
and passed away. 
.
#Pneumonia: On [**2987-2-23**], there was concern for aspiration PNA due 
to persistent R lower lobe hazy opacity since admission, low 
grade fever to 100.8, and increased cough. The patient had 
persistent leukocytosis due to CLL. Sputum gram stain and 
culture were ordered. Patient was started on vancomycin 1000mg 
IV q48 hrs and Zosyn 2.25 gm IV q6.
.
Diastolic Dysfunction/CHF: Patient had an ECHO on [**2987-2-22**] showing 
LVEF>55%. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Grade 
II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation, moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation, and 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is seen. His 
lisinopril 5mg was held because of creatinine trending up to 
2.5.
.
#HTN: Patient was on atenolol 25mg qam on admission, this was 
changed to metoprolol and was titrated to metoprolol 50mg BID 
for improved HTN control. He was on lisinopril 5mg daily on 
admission which was discontinued due to rising creatinine. 
.
#CLL: WBC trended up from 66k to 88k on [**2987-2-23**] and decreased to 
76.7K on [**2987-2-24**]. Patient was on leukoram 2mg daily on admission, 
this was held during admission due to acute medical issues and 
was to be restarted on discharge.
.  
#Chronic renal disease: Patient has Cr has ranged from 1.4-2.5 
during hospital course. Baseline per PCP office is 1.5 in 10/06. 
Fractional excretion Urea: 18% based on urine electrolytes 
indicated creatinine rise likely due to pre-renal disease. 
.  
#Anemia: Patient has chronic anemia per prior PCP notes due to 
CLL and iron deficiency. On admission, the patient's Hct was 
32.1 and it trended down to 28. Stool guaiac was ordered. 
.  
#DMII: Patient had hyperglycemia during hospital course, 
transiently on insulin gtt. He was on glargine 10u daily and 
RISS with QID FSBG. Glargine was decreased to 5u when patient's 
tube feeds were held on [**2987-2-24**] due to concern for aspiration. 
.
#Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 209**] apnea: patient was given a trial of CPAP on 
[**2987-2-23**] in the evening. 
.
#Diet: SLP evaluated patient and determined he may be aspirating 
PO's and given altered MS, so patient continued on NG tube 
feeds. Tube feeds were held on [**2987-2-23**] due to concern for 
aspiration.  
.  
#PPX: Patient was on pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis. Bowel 
regimen with colace and senna.
.  
#Code status: DNR/DNI per health care proxy discussion, 
confirmed on [**2987-2-23**] with discussion with health care proxy.

     INDICATION:  Status post fall with intracranial hemorrhage.  Evaluate for
     fracture.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the cervical spine were obtained
     without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were generated.
     
     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The C5 vertebral body is
     decreased in height relative to other cervical vertebrae.  The finding appears
     chronic, without associated prevertebral or paraspinal soft tissue swelling.
     Other cervical vertebral body heights are relatively maintained. There is loss
     of the normal cervical lordosis, which could be related to patient
     positioning. The prevertebral soft tissues do not appear enlarged, and there
     is a nasogastric tube in place.
     
     Multilevel degenerative changes are seen.  There is intervertebral disc space
     narrowing at nearly all cervical levels, greatest at C5/6 and C6/7.
     Spondylytic ridges result in moderately severe ventral spinal stenosis at
     these levels, with flattening of the ventral cord and narrowing of the right
     neural foramena. CT does not provide intrathecal detail comparable to that of
     MR, however.
     
     There are calcifications of the nuchal ligament, posterior to the C7 and T1
     spinous processes.  There are carotid artery calcifications, bilaterally.
     There are pleural effusions evident at the lung apices, bilaterally. There is
     a right subclavian central venous catheter in place, with the tip located
     beyond the area imaged.  There is diffuse airspace opacification within the
     right lung apex, possibly representing pneumonia or aspiration.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Diffuse loss of height of the C5 vertebral body, chronic in appearance. No
     acute fracture visualized.
     
     2.  Multilevel degenerative changes, with moderately severe cervical spinal
     stenosis at C5/6 and C6/7 levels.
     
     3.  Pneumonia versus aspiration evident within the right lung apex. Bilateral
     pleural effusions reaching the lung apices, partially imaged.
     
     4.  Carotid artery calcifications.

     COMPARISON:  [**2987-2-20**].
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage along the anterior
     inferior aspect of the frontal lobes is slightly more conspicuous on the
     current study.  Small bifrontal subdural hematomas and subdural blood
     extending along the falx cerebri is not significantly changed in the interim.
     Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage is not significantly changed, but there is a
     slightly increased amount of blood layering posteriorly within the lateral
     ventricles.  Subdural hemorrhage layering along the floor of the right middle
     cranial fossa is minimally more conspicuous.  There is no shift of the
     normally midline structures.  The ventricles are unchanged in configuration
     compared with the prior exam.  The visualized paranasal sinuses remain well
     aerated. Fracture of the left temporal bone and hemotympanum are again
     appreciated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Bifrontal intraparenchymal hemorrhages and subdural hemorrhage layering
     along the floor of the right middle cranial fossa appear slightly more
     conspicuous on the current study.  Bifrontal subdural hematomas and subdural
     hemorrhage along the falx cerebri appear not significantly changed in the
     interim, and subarachnoid hemorrhage appears similar in degree.
     2.  No shift of normally midline structures on the current study.  Unchanged
     ventricular size.
     3.  Left temporal bone fracture and hemotympanum again noted.

     AP CHEST 2:15 A.M. [**2-21**]  
     
     HISTORY:  Intracerebral hemorrhage.  Right central venous line placement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
     
     Heart is mildly enlarged, but there is appreciable mediastinal widening at the
     level of the aortic knob that is due in part to a large aorta and mediastinal
     vascular engorgement but may also be due to adenopathy, particularly since
     there is poor definition of the bronchial tree.  Right hilar enlargement is
     more likely vascular than nodal since there is a mild generalized interstitial
     pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion.  Nasogastric tube passes below
     the diaphragm and out of view.  Tip of the right supraclavicular central
     venous line projects over the upper right atrium.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1527**] was paged to
     report these findings, at the time of dictation.
