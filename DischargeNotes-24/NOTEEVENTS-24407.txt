Admission Date:  [**2850-2-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2850-2-22**]

Date of Birth:   [**2754-6-8**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old
female with a history of aortic stenosis status post
valvuloplasty times three complaining of increased
chest/epigastric pain with radiation to her arms.  She was
taken to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 73**].  She was admitted to the Medical Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Aortic stenosis status post
valvuloplasty times three.  Coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction.  Congestive heart failure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, breast cancer,
hypercholesterolemia, right groin pseudoaneurysm.

MEDICATIONS:  Cardizem, Toprol, aspirin, Persantine, Zantac,
Albuterol, Lasix.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and sulfa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile.  Vital signs stable.  Cor
respiratory rate.  +3/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Chest
clear to auscultation.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  It was decided that the patient would have
an aortic valve replacement.  This was performed [**2850-2-16**].  She had a aortic valve replacement with CE #19 valve
placed.  Postoperatively, she was on Levo and Epi, which were
appropriately weaned.  The patient remained sedated
postoperative one, two and three.  A neurology consult was
obtained and they recommended a head CT, which revealed
multiple infarcts.  The patient was also noted to be in a
decerebrate posture.  On [**2-22**], the patient was noted to
have acute right lower ischemia.  A vascular surgery consult
was obtained and it was decided to start the patient on
heparin.  A lactate level was obtained, which was 10.1.  A
general surgery consult was obtained to rule out mesenteric
ischemia.  They elected to treat the patient conservatively.
A repeat head CT at the request of neurology was obtained on
[**2-20**], which continued to show multiple infarcts.  The
patient continued to remain decerebrate posture.  On [**2-22**], the patient remained in a deep coma and neurology
declared the patient as an extremely poor prognosis.  A
lengthy conversation was obtained between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] and the
patient's family.  It was decided at that time to make the
patient comfort measures only and DNR.  The patient expired
[**2850-2-22**] at 5:30 p.m.
