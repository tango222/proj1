History of Present Illness:
HPI: 94M with PMH notable for CAD, CHF (EF 20-25%) was brought 
to the ED this morning by his family with whom he lives. Prior 
to this morning, the pt was at his baseline, and had taken a 
number of day trips with his fmaily over the past 2 weeks.  This 
morning, the pt's granddaughter went to his basement apt to look 
in on him (his son and son's famly live upstairs) and found that 
he was trembling and a bit confused. The pt's son then assessed 
his father, and gave him Benadryl (1 tab) for the shaking. He 
was sweating and clammy, but his temp later was >102 po The pt 
then took his usual am meds with Glucerna, but vomited a frothy 
emesis. He was then transported to the ED.  
.  
Per the pt's family, he had been feeling fine prior to this 
morning. he had not complained of cough or SOB, nor had he 
mentioned difficulty voiding or dysuria. His son empties a 
bedside commode in the am for him, and has identified past UTIs 
by malodorous urine, which he did not identify today. He had not 
complained of CP or SOB. No GI sx, no bowel changes, no previous 
fever/chills/malaise. He had not c/o HA or neck stiffness, or 
pain of any kind. Pt had no recent exotic travel or known sick 
contacts.  
.  
In the ED, the pt was initially stable but satting 84% RA. ON MD 
exam, sat improved (?on NC), but temp was 104 with HR 60s, BP 
134/61. He was minimally responsive (s/p benadryl) and exam was 
notable for bibasilar rales. Because he was obtunded and had 
ememis in ED with ?aspiration, he was intubated for airway 
protection and quickly became hypotensive (BP min 105/50 prior 
to sedation). He received 5L NS boluses (levophed started after 
3L), as well as 2 g CTX, 1 gm vanc, 500 mg metronidazole, 1 g 
tylenol, etomidate, succinylcholine, 10 mg dexamethasone, 2mg 
midazolam x 2, levophed gtt, propofol gtt. He was subsequently 
transferred to the FICU for further therapy and monitoring.

Echo [**8-11**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and  cavity size are normal. There is severe 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of 
the distal half of the ventricle. Basal segments are 
hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) 
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Aortic stenosis is not suggested. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  
.
[**8-12**] Hip Film:
AP film of the pelvis plus two added views of the left hip and 
proximal left femur. There is a bipolar left hip 
hemiarthroplasty with cemented femoral stem. A poorly visualized 
fracture of the proximal femoral shaft has been fixated by 
apparent large osseous allografts with associated cerclage wires 
and long lateral plate (with four screws below the tip of the 
femoral stem). Overall appearances are unchanged from [**0-0-0**] with no focal bone destruction or evidence of hardware 
loosening. The right hip and SI joints are normal.
.
IMPRESSION: No short interval change. No radiographic evidence 
infection or loosening.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT
Reason: please image left hip and thigh to rule out fluid 
collection
.
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with grp B strep bacteremia with history of left 
hip fracture last year, hardware in place. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please image left hip and thigh to rule out fluid collection 
INDICATION: Left leg swelling. Evaluate for deep venous 
thrombosis.
.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler 
sonograms of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, and 
popliteal veins were performed. There is normal flow, 
augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms. Intraluminal 
thrombus is not identified.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course, by Problem:
.
# Grp B strep septicemia: this was felt to be likely due to GU 
source given active urinalysis, though urine cx negative.  A TTE 
negative was negative for any vegetations adherent to the 
patients valves or pacer wires.  The patients' family wished to 
defer a TEE.  ID was consulted and recommended 4 weeks IV CTX as 
well as 
rechecking ESR/CRP in 2 weeks to see if rising.  Of note, a Left 
hip plain film and LLE u/s to r/o fluid collection showed no 
significant findings.  The longer course was recommended by ID 
as the exact source of the bacteremia was unclear and 
endocarditis was not fully ruled out.
.
#CVS 
Ischemia:  the patient had several sets of CE during this 
admission which were negative, despite lateral TWI on the 
patients ECG.
Pump:  the patient was slightly overloaded after fluid 
resusciation in the ICU.  He was diuresed and then restarted on 
his home Lasix dose.  Of note, repeat Echo during this admission 
showed an EF of 25% with (worsening) 2+ MR.  His amlodipine and 
long-acting nitrate were discontinued during this admission d/t 
hypotension.
Rhythm:  the patient was continued on Sotalol, as was 
intermittently in A fib.  Per the family, the patient has a 
history of several falls.  Further discussion of the 
risks/benefits of AC will be deferred to the patient's PCP.  
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] his ICU admission, given relative bradycardia, he had his 
pacer interrogated and the settings were modified to increase 
his baseline HR.  Per EP, pt should follow-up in pacemaker 
clinic after his discharge.  
Prevention:  the patient was kept on Aspirin.  The patient would 
likely benefit from the addition of a statin as an outpatient.
. 
#Confusion: the patient was noted to be intermittently confused 
during his hospitalization.  During the morning of 9/11, the 
patient was almost obtunted and barely responsed to sternal rub. 
 At this time, CT head/ABG/ECG/Fingerstick/CXR were all 
unrevealing.  Later in the day the patient was noted to be 
incredibly more alter and conversing with his family memebers.  
Per discussion with his sons, the patient gets extremely 
confused during most hospital admissions.  Detrol was 
discontinued d/t possibility for anticholingeric effects.
.
#Hypoxia/COPD:  on the day of discharge the patient was noted to 
be slightly hypoxic (88-92RA).  CXR from the day earlier did not 
show over CHF but did show small (B) effusions.  Given the 
patient's immoblitiy, a CT scan was ordered which did not show a 
PE, but only RLL atelectasis and evidence of emphysema.  The 
patient was amublated and did not desat (and in fact, O2 sats 
improved to 92-94RA).  The etiology was felt to be from 
atelectasis and immobility.  Upon discharge, the patient was 
started on a Flovent Inhaler along with Atrovent given the CT 
findings.  The patient would likely benefit from outpt PFTs to 
characterize the degree of his obstructive lung disease.

     Portable chest dated [**2572-8-8**] at 13:35 is compared to the same examination from
     2 hours earlier.  The left hemithorax, lateral portion, has been excluded from
     the film.  The left-sided pacemaker, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube
     are in stable position.  There has been interval placement of a right
     subclavian central venous catheter which terminates in the right atrium.  The
     cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, although the left lateral and lower
     lung regions are not visualized on this examination.  There has been interval
     increase in pulmonary vasculature engorgement.  Within the visualized lung
     fields, there is no focal air space opacification to suggest consolidation.
     There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The surrounding osseous
     and soft tissue structures that are visualized are stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1. Interval placement of a right subclavian central venous
     catheter terminating in the right atrium.  If the desired location is within
     the superior vena cava, pulling back the line approximately 7 cm is
     recommended.
     2. Interval increase in pulmonary vasculature engorgement without overt
     congestive heart failure.  No pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with urosepsis, status post line placement.
     
     Portable chest dated [**2572-8-8**] at 13:35 is compared to the same examination from
     2 hours earlier.  The left hemithorax, lateral portion, has been excluded from
     the film.  The left-sided pacemaker, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube
     are in stable position.  There has been interval placement of a right
     subclavian central venous catheter which terminates in the right atrium.  The
     cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, although the left lateral and lower
     lung regions are not visualized on this examination.  There has been interval
     increase in pulmonary vasculature engorgement.  Within the visualized lung
     fields, there is no focal air space opacification to suggest consolidation.
     There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The surrounding osseous
     and soft tissue structures that are visualized are stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1. Interval placement of a right subclavian central venous
     catheter terminating in the right atrium.  If the desired location is within
     the superior vena cava, pulling back the line approximately 7 cm is
     recommended.
     2. Interval increase in pulmonary vasculature engorgement without overt
     congestive heart failure.  No pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with change in mental status.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of normally
     midline structures, mass effect or hydrocephalus.  There is prominence of the
     ventricles and sulci consistent with age-related involutional change.
     Periventricular white matter hypodensity is consistent with chronic
     microvascular ischemia.  Focal areas of low attenuation within the cerebellar
     hemispheres likely represent remote infarcts.  No major vascular territorial
     infarct is identified.  Calcifications are noted within the supraclinoid
     vertebral arteries.
     
     Soft tissue windows demonstrate diffuse opacification with air-fluid levels
     involving the bilateral maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and nasal
     passages with foci of hyperdense material due to blood or protinaceous fluid .
     Hyperdense 13 x 8 mm ovoid structure gated along the right nasal septum likely
     represents a blood clot or less likely a large nasal polyp.  No fractures are
     identified on bone algorithm windows. Trace fluid is seen within the bilateral
     mastoid air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
     2.  Extensive opacification of the paranasal sinuses with hyperdense material
     indicating blood could be related to retained secretions in this intubated
     patient.  
     Findings were relayed to the ED dashboard at 3:00 p.m. on [**2572-8-8**].

Neuro:  Pt remains sedated on propofol, he has required 2cc boluses fairly frequently through the day for aggitation, his gtt was increased from 10 mcg/kg/min to 15 and he has cont to need boluses with this increase.  

CV:  His HR was in the 40s this morning and his SBP was 82, CVP 15, he was restarted on levo at .03mcg/kg/min.  He was given a 500cc NS bolus, his CVP increased to 17 from 15 but his U/O did not improve.  He was seen by cardiology, they changed his pacer so he will not drop below 60 and took him out of [**Doctor Last Name **] mode that he had been in causing his HR to drop to the 40s at night.  He was able to come off of the levo this afternoon and has remained off of it, he is again receiving a 500cc bolus for a low u/o - his CVP was 15 at the start of the bolus.

Resp:  Pt remains vented on PSV, his PS was increased to 8 from 5, he is still on 5 of PEEP and 50%, 02 SATs have been in the upper 90s to 100%.  No plans on extubating his today due to his increased fluid requirements.  His sputum came back with 3+ budding yeast with pseudohyphae - awaiting sensativities.

GI:  Started on TF, no stool today, abd is obese with pos BS.

GU:  u/o 15-40cc/hr.  Red colored urine which was clearing some today but is again becoming a stronger colored red.  His foley was flushed - he didn't have any clots and his u/o did not improve with this.  He has received 2 NS boluses for his low u/o.

Endo:  Remains on an insulin gtt 2-3 units/hr.

Soc:  Two of his sons were in today, involved with his care, are interested in getting him home as soon as possible.  They said that he is very strong and he will pull out anything if able to.  He becomes very disoriented when he is out of his environment and has required sitters in the past.

Neuro:  Pt was on Propofol this morning but it was d/ced just prior to extubation.  After he was extubated he became very aggitated, he pulled out his aline, trying to kick and hit the staff.  He was in 3 point soft restraints and sitters were ordered.  He has been better with the sitters though at times he has been aggitated.  He was given .5 mg of IV ativan with some effect.  His granddaughter was in this afternoon, he did not recognize her.

CV:  His SBP increased to 165  after he was extubated, HR to the 90s-100s, hewas given 20mg of IV lasix has has had a good responce to it without dropping his BP.  He is occationally in a paced rhythm otherwise he is a SR with occational PVCs.

Resp:  Extubated, he has what sounds like sputum in the back of his throat but he won't let me suction it out.  He makes a poor effort to take a deep breath but it sounds like he has clear lungs. He is on 4 L NC with an 02 SAT in the mid to upper 90s.

GI:  TF were stopped last night, ABD obese, pos BS.

GU:  Good u/o after the lasix, he is ~ 6 liters pos for LOS.  His urine is no longer red, it is slightly pink.  Per his son he take 40mg PO lasix BID.

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old post-fixation left femoral fracture, bacteremia.
     
     AP film of the pelvis plus two added views of the left hip and proximal left
     femur.  There is a bipolar left hip hemiarthroplasty with cemented femoral
     stem.  A poorly visualized fracture of the proximal femoral shaft has been
     fixated by apparent large osseous allografts with associated cerclage wires
     and long lateral plate (with four screws below the tip of the femoral stem).
     Overall appearances are unchanged from [**2572-7-31**] with no focal bone
     destruction or evidence of hardware loosening.  The right hip and SI joints
     are normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No short interval change.  No radiographic evidence infection or
     loosening.

     INDICATION:  Congestive heart failure.
     
     AP view of the chest is obtained [**2572-8-17**] at 12:11 hours and is compared with
     the recent radiograph of [**2572-8-14**].  The study is made somewhat suboptimal by
     respiratory movement.  Within this limitation, there does not appear to have
     been any marked change since the prior examination.  Cardiomegaly with

     pleural effusions are evident.  The right-sided PICC line has been removed.  A
     left-sided transvenous bipolar pacemaker is visualized.

     appearance of brain parenchyma is unchanged.  Multifocal areas of
     hypoattenuation involving the left parietal lobe, right frontal and cerebellum
     are unchanged again likely representing small chronic infarcts.
     Periventricular white matter hypoattenuation is also unchanged, consistent
     with chronic microvascular ischemia.  There has been interval improvement in
     the previously identified diffuse opacification of the visualized paranasal
     sinuses, with residual mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus and
     air-fluid level in left maxillary sinus.  The osseous structures are
     unremarkable.

     the tip of the catheter to be located in the right axillary vein.  A 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced through the catheter into the distal part of the
     SVC.  The catheter was then exchanged for a needle single-lumen catheter. 
     Based on the markers in the guidewire it was decided that a length of 48 cm
     would be suitable.  The line was then trimmed to this length and advanced over
     the wire and under fluoroscopic guidance into the distal part of the SVC.  The
     line was then flushed, heplocked, StatLocked.  The final fluoroscopic image of
     the chest demonstrated the tip of the catheter to be located in the distal
     part of the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful replacement of a PICC line for a 48 cm long single-
     lumen line via the right basilic vein with tip positioned in the distal part
     of the SVC.  The line is ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with hypoxia and immobility.  Rule out pulmonary
     embolism.
     
     COMPARISON:  CTA chest dated [**2572-1-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the chest was performed before and after the
     administration of 120 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was
     administered per protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
     obtained.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM CHEST:  There are no filling defects within the pulmonary artery,
     proximal or distal branches to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
     The patient is status post left chest wall pacemaker.  There are mild coronary
     artery calcifications, and moderate calcifications along the aortic arch.  The
     heart, pericardium, and great vessels are otherwise unremarkable.  There is no
     pleural or pericardial effusion.  There is no mediastinal, axillary, or hilar
     lymphadenopathy. A single right hilar lumph node measuring 1 cm is unchanged
     for prior study. Debris is seen throughout the thoracic esophagus, and there
     is a small hiatal hernia. On lung windows, there is mild primarily central
     bilateral emphysema. There is a 15 x 3 mm pleural-based lesion (3/124) in the
     right upper lobe, which is unchanged since prior exam. Few 3- mm nodules
     adjacent to the right major fissure ([**2-/2539**] and [**2-/2535**]) are unchanged since prior
     exam.  There is new right lower lobe atelectasis, and a focal area of ground
     glass opacity at the left lung base that was not previously seen. Finally, a 9
     x 7 mm nodular density within the left lingula appears slightly more prominent
     than on prior exam.
     
     Limited imaging of the upper abdomen again reveals the small hiatal hernia.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
     abnormalities.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Stable right upper lobe pleural thickening, and 2-3 mm nodules adjacent to
     the right major fissure.
     3.  Increased prominence of left lingular nodule as described above. Dedicated
     chest CT within three months' time is recommended for further evaluation.
                                                                 (Over)

     AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2572-8-21**] AT 11:53 HOURS
     
     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with bacteremia.  PICC line placed for IV
     antibiotics.  Check placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recent dated [**2572-8-17**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, there has been a right upper
     extremity approach PICC line.  Technique and body habitus combined to make
     distal tip difficult to discern.  As best can be determined, however, the
     distal tip does appear to be in the superior vena cava in the region of the
     cavoatrial junction.  A dual chamber pacemaker is stable in course and
     position.  Lung volumes are diminished with bibasilar atelectasis, right worse
     than left.  Pulmonary vascular clarity is diminished likely indicative of a
     mild element of hydrostatic edema.  A tortuous atherosclerotic aorta is seen.
     The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size with a left
     ventricular configuration.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PICC line tip difficult to definitively discern, however, as best
     can be determined the distal tip is in appropriate position.  Right basilar
     opacity is likely atelectasis.  An early developing pneumonia cannot be
     entirely excluded.  Recommend followup exam as clinically indicated.

     CHEST, PA AND LATERAL
     
     INDICATION:  Cough and low-grade fevers, evaluate for aspiration pneumonitis.
     
     FINDINGS:  Patient's condition does not permit examination in standard PA and
     lateral views.  AP and lateral views are obtained with patient in sitting
     semi-erect position with considerable left-sided tilt on the frontal view.
     There is mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement, and the presence of a left-
     sided permanent pacer with dual electrode system is noted.  Termination points
     of electrode compatible with right atrial appendage and apical portion of
     right ventricle.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. In
     the retrocardiac position on the left base, a triangular-shaped parenchymal
     density is identified which on the lateral view matches a density in the
     posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe.  Appearance and location is
     compatible with the clinical suspicion of an aspiration pneumonitis.  No other
     significant parenchymal abnormalities can be identified, and there is no
     evidence of significant pleural effusion in either lateral or posterior
     pleural sinuses.  There exist multiple previous chest examinations in this
     patient's record; however, films are not available for direct comparison.
     Search results in identification of a chest examination dated [**2572-8-11**].  On this portable examination, heart size was also considered to be top
     normal, and the patient had already the pacer.  A pneumonic infiltrate was not
     identified at that time.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Local parenchymal infiltrate in left lower lobe posterior segment
     compatible with clinical suspicion of aspiration pneumonitis.  Stat report
     delivered to [**Hospital Unit Name 1339**] board.
