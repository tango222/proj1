CT TORSO
1. Significant interval increase in the size of the large left 
upper lobe mass as well as interval worsening of the liver and 
splenic metastases.
2. Diffuse septal thickening, which may relate to congestive 
heart failure. Lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded.
3. Mottled appearance of the iliac bones, which may relate to 
metastatic lesions.

ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are  
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic 
function  
appears moderately depressed with global hypokinesis. [Intrinsic 
left  
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the 
severity of  
valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is 
dilated. Right  
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. [Intrinsic 
right ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given 
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet 
is eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small 
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in 
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.  
No vegetations seen (cannot exclude).  
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable 
for review) of [**3090-9-11**], biventricular abnormalities are new and 
mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now 
significantly worse.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for sepsis and started on the MUST protocol.  
Source of infection felt to be from the lungs, as pt with stage 
4 lung cancer with rapidly growing tumor.  Felt to have post 
obstructive PNA.  He was started on 
vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone/levo after being intubated in the ED.  
He was started on levophed to maintain MAP>65.  He was 
aggressively hydrated to keep CVP 8-12.  This was then backed 
off as CVP was > 15.  Held his diuretics and anti-HTN meds.  Pt 
was also in ARF was cr at 3.4 but this quickly improved with 
fluids.  We were able to wean his vent settings to CPAP.  He was 
seen by hepatology in regards to his liver transplant and 
continued on tacrolimus.  Also followed by onc for his cancer.  
It was felt that his cancer was end stage and no further 
treatment was available given the extent of his disease.  With 
time pressors were weaned off.  As patient improved he was 
asking that the ETT be removed.  He ended up self extubating 
himself.  But only lasted about 30 minutes before he became 
severely acidotic and required reintubation.  He then self 
extubated himself for a second and asked that he not be 
re-intubated.  Discussion was held with family and patient.  
Given poor prognosis due to the cancer, pt decided he wanted no 
further treatment and requested comfort measures only.  All meds 
were stopped except for morphine, ativan.  These were titrated 
to comfort.  Pt then expired on [**3097-1-28**] at 1235pm with his 
family at the bedside.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Metastatic lung cancer, new fever, falling hematocrit.  Evaluate
     for abscess, hemorrhage, or new pleural effusion.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the femoral heads without intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from [**3096-12-2**] and a CT of the abdomen and
     pelvis from [**3096-11-18**].
     
     CT chest without IV contrast:  There is a very large mass in the left upper
     lobe, which has significantly increased in size from [**3096-12-2**].  At the level
     of the aortic arch, this mass spans the entire A-P diameter of the chest.
     There is increased atelectasis of the left lower lobe, presumably related to
     compression from the large left upper lobe mass.  There are small bilateral
     pleural effusions.  The heart is enlarged.  There is diffuse septal
     thickening, which may relate to congestive heart failure.  However,
     lymphangitic spread of cancer cannot be excluded.  The endotracheal tube
     extends to just above the carina.
     
     Abdomen without IV contrast:  There are numerous large low attenuation masses
     throughout the liver, significantly increased in size and number from
     [**3096-11-18**].  These findings are consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.
     The splenic metastasis is also increased in size, currently measuring 5.3 x
     5.4 cm.  The pancreas is unremarkable on unenhanced scan.  The adrenal glands
     and kidneys appear normal.  There is extensive ascites throughout the abdomen
     and pelvis, significantly increased in extent from the prior study. The
     opacified loops of bowel are unremarkable.  The IVC is prominent, which may
     relate to congestive heart failure.  This appearance is not significantly
     changed in the interval.  However, thrombosis in this region cannot be
     excluded on this unenhanced scan.
     
     CT pelvis without IV contrast:  A Foley catheter is in place.  There is
     extensive ascites throughout the pelvis.  Diffuse vascular calcifications are
     also noted.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate a mottled appearance of the iliac bones bilaterally,
     adjacent to the sacroiliac joints.  These findings raise concern for
                                                                 (Over)

     mass as well as interval worsening of the liver and splenic metastases.
     2.  Diffuse septal thickening, which may relate to congestive heart failure.
     Lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded.
     3.  Mottled appearance of the iliac bones, which may relate to metastatic
     lesions.

   pt stable, restarted fentanyl at low dose d/t pt w hx pelvic pain, and goal to avoid w/drawal syndrome;
   urine output low, v-response increased to 130's up to 150 at times; received 500 cc IVF boluses over the night x2; did also receive IV lopressor 5 mg x2, 2nd dose after 2nd 500 bolus infused--to avoid hypotension;  hrt rate did decrease to low 100's/low 110's;
   urine output remained low overnight despite fluid boluses; BUN/creatinine w/out much change from previous;

g-i:
started on Nepro, tolerated increase w/ scant resids overnight, currently at 30 cc/hr, which is current goal for this formula; whith continued toleration, nurition c/s suggests switching to Nepro [**1-21**] to promode 55 g daily, with goal 45 cc/hr;

NPN

Neuro:  Pt alert and oriented, able to understand a fair amount of english, able to participate some in his care.

CV:  Pt was started on lopressor 25mg per OGT, this lowered his HR from the 120s-150s to the 90s-100s, SBP also decreased from the 120s-130s to the 90s.

Resp:  Remains vented, he was tried on PS of 5/5 and his ABG was 7.18/58/60, he was placed back on A/C 16/500/5/.5 and his ABG was 7.27/45/100 - his rate was increaed to 22.  Sx for a mod amount of yellow secreations.

GI:  He remains on nepro at 30cc/hr - his goal rate.  He has been intermitantly c/o feeling nauseated for short periods of time.  He has been ordered for compazine.  His abd remains firm, hypoactive BS, he did have a lg BM today.

GU:  Poor u/o ~ 2-10cc/hr, there was some discussion on rounds about starting lasix but it has not been ordered.

Endo:  He is now back on an insulin gtt to maintain a BS 80-120.

Soc:  There was a family meeting today to discuss end of life choices. The attending, intern, myself, an italian interpreter, and his family were there.  We talked to him about taking him off of the vent and keeping him comfortable on morphine gtt vs taking him off of the vent with the option of putting him back on the vent if he didn't tolerate being extubated.  He talked to his family after the meeting and per his SO he would want to go back on the vent if he needed to.  We will have another discussion with him tomorrow with the interpreter.
