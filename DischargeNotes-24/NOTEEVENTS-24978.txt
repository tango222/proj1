Service:  [**Company 36**] FIRM
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old gentlemen
with a past medical history significant for AIDS, most recent
CD4 count 99 and viral load greater than 300,000, congestive
heart failure, diabetes [**Company 6449**] and history of lymphoma who
presents with a one week history of Voluminous diarrhea 10 to
positive abdominal pain which is diffuse, not related to foot
intake or bowel movements.  No nausea or vomiting.  Decreased
appetite and decreased po intakes times seven days.  Patient
does have a recent history of C. difficile toxin positive on
[**3072-9-10**].  He was treated with Flagyl for one week at
that time with good resolution of his diarrhea, but
subsequent recurrence in two to three weeks.  Also reports
to admission and rigors at home one day prior to admission.
He also noted decreased urine output for one to two days with
no urine output for 18 hours prior to admission.  He reports
weakness and fatigue, also, increased sensitivity to light,
flash photophobia for three days with accompanied neck
stiffness/pain which is new for him.  No confusion or mental
status changes.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was afebrile.  Blood
pressure was 62/36.  Respiratory rate was between 25 and 35
and heart rate was 100.  He was noted to have a creatinine of
4.3 with a baseline of 0.8.  An anion gap of 16, white blood
cell count of 9.8 with 18% bands.  Arterial blood gases
showed a pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 30, pO2 of 71.  Also notable is
five days history of Vioxx that he started for lower back
pain.  Also reports subjective shortness of breath for one to
two days.  No relationship to exercise.

In the Emergency Room, he was orthostatic by heart rate.
Urine and blood cultures were sent.  Chest x-ray showed mild
congestive heart failure.  Electrocardiogram was without
change.  Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were initiated.
He was given four days of normal saline with minimal blood
pressure response.  Foley was placed with small amount of
concentrated urine output.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
because of his hypotension and acute renal failure.  He was
hydrated overnight and was transferred to the General
Medicine Floor the following day.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 54-year-old gentlemen with history of
AIDS and congestive heart failure admitted with seven days of
perfuse diarrhea, fevers and chills found to be in acute
renal failure with a creatinine of 4.3 and hypotensive and
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for one night,
transferred to the floor after receiving aggressive
intravenous hydration and starting antibiotics.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Infectious Disease:  It was felt that the patient's
diarrhea was the most likely source of his fevers and chills
and had caused severe dehydration leading to hypotension,
acute renal failure with prerenal and intrarenal ATM effect.
Given his history of AIDS, a SMV cryptococcus [**Doctor First Name **] were
checked as were microsporidia, cryptosporidia, Isospora and
cyclosporia when these were negative.  Given his recent
consumption of shellfish, vibrio was also checked and this
was negative.  Given his increased white blood cells, count
with left shift and increased bands, as well as a guaiac
positive nature on the floor, bacterial cultures of stools
including Campylobacter, Salmonella and Shigella were checked
and were all negative.  Given his recent antibiotics and his
recent C. difficile infection, the C. difficile was
rechecked, one was negative and one was positive.  Ova and
parasites were negative and E. coli 0157H7 was also negative.
Patient's first urinalysis was consistent with a urinary
tract infection, although the urine culture showed no growth.
Second urinalysis and sedimentation was consistent with ATN
and not a urinary tract infection.  ATN was most likely
secondary to decreased perfusion of the kidneys during his
hypotensive episode.  An lumbar puncture was deferred given
resolution of his neck stiffness and pain and a clinical
picture not consistent with meningitis.  The patient remained
afebrile after 24 hours after admission.  The patient's
diarrhea continued and actually worsened to become more
watery in consistency and more frequent as his hospital stay
went on until the day of discharge.  He remained afebrile and
continued to have diffuse abdominal tenderness.  The Staph
coag negative that grew in his blood was considered a
contaminant, however, before this was isolated, he was placed
back on vancomycin which had been discontinued when he moved
to the floor.  His Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were continued
also.  His CD4 count was lower than it had been in the past
and this made opportunistic infections as the cause of his
diarrhea more likely and that is why his microsporidian,
cryptosporidia, Isosporidium, cyclosporia was sent.
Patient's Ciprofloxacin was increased to 500 mg b.i.d. as his
renal function improved and his Flagyl was also continued.
An antidiarrheal [**Doctor Last Name 978**] was avoided especially since he was
found to be C. difficile positive.  And eventually, two days
prior to discharge, his Ciprofloxacin was discontinued.

Patient continued with pandemia and this should be followed
up as an outpatient.  It may be secondary to his C. difficile
infection.  If his diarrhea had continued without
improvement, CT of the abdomen and colonoscopy with biopsies
to rule out CMV and [**Doctor First Name **] would have been considered more
seriously.  His acyclovir was held off because of his renal
dysfunction.  He continued to be hydrated until two days
prior to discharge when his intravenous fluids were
discontinued since he was taking good po intake.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Patient's hypotension was most likely
secondary to dehydration from his diarrhea.  Other
possibilities postulated were septic shock with infection and
cardiogenic shock, although, he did not have any signs and
symptoms of congestive heart failure.  His blood pressure did
not initially respond to aggressive intravenous hydration,
but then did and he was transferred to the floor.  His blood
pressure on the floor remained stable throughout his four
days.

3.  Renal:  Patient was presenting with acute renal failure
most likely secondary to prerenal from decreased perfusion
from his hypotension and ATN.  His Vioxx was also held as
this may have been a contributing factor five days prior to
admission.  No hydronephrosis was on renal ultrasound.  His
medications were initially renally dosed and he was hydrated
aggressively.  His renal function remarkably improved to
normal within two days after starting his aggressive
hydration.  Patient was found to have metabolic acidosis but
normal lactate and with compensatory increased respiratory
rate.  After his kidney function resolved, his medications
were increased back to their normal doses.  His Foley was
discontinued on hospital day number three.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  Patient with history of hepatomegaly
and now with abdominal tenderness.  This most likely
secondary to his diarrhea versus ischemic bowel from his
hypotension.  His exam was following and was unchanged so an
abdominal CT was not done.

5.  Diabetes [**Doctor First Name 6449**]:  Patient was placed on a regular
insulin sliding scale.  Hemoglobin A1C was sent and was found
to be elevated at 8 which is better than his value in [**3072-7-3**] which was 8.5, but still showing that his diabetes is
not well-controlled.  This should be discussed as an
outpatient.

CONDITION OF DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

PATIENT DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient is to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3258**] within one week.  Patient is to call the
Infectious Disease fellow on call if he experiences any more
fevers or chills or increased in his diarrhea or pain.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  As prior to admission with the
addition of Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. for a total course of 21
days.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  HIV/AIDS.
2.  C. difficile diarrhea.
3.  Diabetes [**Last Name (STitle) 6449**].
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Peripheral neuropathy.
7.  Depression.
