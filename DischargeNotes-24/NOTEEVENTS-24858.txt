     Reason: rlq abscess w/ desaturation and dyspnea
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old woman with  rlq phlegmon
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      rlq abscess w/ desaturation and dyspnea
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT PHLEGMON AND ABSCESS.  DESATURATION AND
     DYSPNEA.  RULE OUT PULMONARY INFILTRATE.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP upright image is provided.  Comparison study dated
     [**2743-3-21**].  There is again evidence of left ventricular enlargement of
     the heart.  A dual chamber pacemaker is noted with both electrodes in
     satisfactory portion.  A orogastric tube is noted with its tip satisfactorily
     positioned in the stomach.  The pulmonary vessels show slight upper zone
     redistribution.  No focal pulmonary infiltrates are seen though minimal
     atelectasis may be present at the costophrenic angles.  No definite pleural
     effusions are seen.  An oxygen mask is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The findings suggest slight LV decompensation.  This is slightly
     more marked on than the prior study of [**2743-3-19**].

     Reason: right SC triple lumen placement
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old woman with  rlq phlegmon
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      right SC triple lumen placement
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  78 year old female with right lower quadrant phlegmon and new
     triple-lumen catheter placement.
     
     Portable AP radiograph of the chest dated [**2744-2-16**] at 1:42PM is compared with a
     portable AP chest radiograph from 5:09AM of the same day.
     
     The endotracheal tube terminates with tip approximately 2.5 cm above the
     carina.  The right subclavian central venous catheter tip is poorly visualized
     but appears to lie within the proximal SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
     left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker and nasogastric tube are unchanged and in
     satisfactory position.  Since the prior examination, there is apparent
     widening of the mediastinum with numerous linear and circular lucencies
     suggesting pneumomediastinum.  There is partial obscuration of the right
     hemidiaphragm, indicative of right lower lobe consolidation/collapse.  Left
     ventricular enlargement is stable.  Small pleural effusions cannot be
     excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Right subclavian central venous line tip probably in proximal SVC although
     difficult to visualize.  No pneumothorax.
     
     2) Widening of the mediastinum with probably pneumomediastinum that could be
     the result of endotracheal tube or subclavian instrumentation.  Interval
     follow-up radiographs are recommended.

      lung mass (also please assess for breast mass if possible via CT)
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA TO THE LIVER OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY.
     
     Comparison is made to prior chest CT dated [**2742-9-3**].
     
     Helical CT of the thorax was performed with 5 mm collimation and 5 mm
     reconstruction intervals without intravenous or oral contrast administration.
     Additionally, a small series of images were retrospectively reconstructed with
     2.5 mm collimation.
     
     Assessment of the lungs is somewhat limited by respiratory motion,
     particularly through the lung apices and lung bases.  There is a tiny lung
     nodule present near the minor fissure on image #22 of series 3.  This is
     without change since [**2742-9-3**].  On thin section images, this shows
     evidence of definitive benign calcification pattern, consistent with a small
     granuloma.
     
     Assessment of the remaining portions of the lungs demonstrates a linear focus
     of increased opacity in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe stable
     from before and attributed to focal scarring.  There is new consolidation
     involving the right lower lobe, particularly the dependent portions.  Within
     the left lower lobe, there are patchy ground-glass opacities which are new in
     the interval since the previous study.  No obstructing endobronchial lesions
     are evident.
     
     Assessment of the skeletal structures of the thorax reveals degenerative
     changes within the spine.
     
     Assessment of the soft tissue structures of the thorax demonstrates extensive
     streak artifact in the upper left portion of the chest due to an implanted
     pacemaking device in the anterior left chest wall.  Assessment of the
     mediastinum demonstrates several small mediastinal nodes mostly in the lower
     paratracheal and precarinal region, which do not appear significantly changed
     in the interval.  No significant hilar lymph node enlargement is evident.  The
     heart is mildly enlarged and coronary artery calcifications are noted.  No
     pericardial effusion is evident.  There is a small right pleural effusion.
     
     Assessment of the abdominal viscera due to absence of intravenous contrast
     administration which significantly decreases the sensitivity of CT for
     detecting hepatic lesions.  There is a large low density lesion in the left
     lobe of liver measuring approximately 4.1 cm in greatest dimension.  An
     additional smaller lesion is seen just below this lesion.  No definite lesions
     are seen in the right lobe of the liver, but absence of intravenous contrast
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     significantly limits the assessment of the liver.
     
     The spleen, adrenal glands, imaged portions of the pancreas and kidneys are
     unremarkable. There is some sludge within the gallbladder.  Please note that
     the liver, kidneys, and pancreas are incompletely imaged on this study as well
     as the gallbladder.
     
     No gross masses are seen in either breast, but mammography is much more
     sensitive than CT for detecting breast cancer.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No CT findings to suggest a primary lung mass as the cause of metastatic
     disease.
     
     2.  A small calcified lung nodule is stable compared to [**2742-9-3**] and
     consistent with a benign granuloma.
     
     3.  Low density lesions in the left lobe of the liver, in keeping with history
     of neoplasm.  Please note that incomplete imaging of the liver as well as
     absence of intravenous contrast markedly limits evaluation of this organ.  If
     a dedicated liver study has not been performed previously, dedicated liver MR
     would be recommended.
     
     4.  Right lower lobe consolidation and small right pleural effusion.  The
     consolidation most likely represents an acute process such as pneumonia or
     aspiration. If this fails to resolve, one should also consider a more chronic
     process such as bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:
     Liver lesion, adenocarcinoma by biopsy. Evaluate for primary.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     The liver was scanned without IV contrast. This was followed by scanning of
     the chest abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast.
     
     IV CONTRAST:
     150 cc of Optiray was given because of history of diabetes.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:
     The lungs have improved since the previous examination of [**2-24**]. It
     appears the right lobe infiltrate has resolved. The tiny pulmonary nodule is
     unchanged. There is no lymphadenopathy seen. The great vessels are
     unremarkable.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:
     An inhomogeneously enhancing liver lesion is seen in the left lobe,
     peripherally, measuring 3.2 cm. There are other smaller sattelite hypodense
     lesions seen close by. The lesion has a thick peripheral enhancing rim. The
     right lobe of the liver as well as the lateral (midline) segment of the left
     lobe (segment IV) appear uninvolved. The pancreas, spleen and kidneys are
     normal. The kidneys excrete contrast in normal fashion. No masses seen. There
     is no peritoneal or retroperitoneal lymphadenopath or other masses
     appreciated.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
     Status post hysterectomy. There are no abnormal masses seen in the pelvis. The
     urinary bladder is within normal limits. The ureters and visualized bowel is
     normal. There appears to be a cystocele and rectocele present but no masses
     appreciated.
     
     IMPRESSION: Liver nodules in the peripheral part of the left lobe of the
     liver. In view of the relative local distribution the possiblity of primary
     hepatoma is raised. No other extrahepatic mass appreiated. Status post
     hysterectomy (? cause); please correlate.
