Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 5409**] 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RUL, RML, superior seg of RLL resection

 
History of Present Illness:
79 yo female with hx of HTN, presented to a cardiologist(Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) 1684**]) for a 1 month hx of productive cough. There an EKG 
revealed new T-wave inversions and patient was sent to [**Hospital 5410**], where she had elevated Trop I of 0.36. Patient started 
on nirto gtt and lovenox. She also had a CT scan that revealed a 
RUQ mass, and a bronch was done. There were no endobronchial 
lesions, but the R upper lobe revealed easy friability, 
bronchial washings were negative for malignant cells, and 
bronchial cx were positive for diptheroids.  Patient was 
imperically treated with Levofloxacin and then switched to 
clindamycin. Patient was recommended to have a pneumonectomy, 
but wanted a 2nd opinion and no furter work-up had been done. 
She was sent to [**Hospital1 25**] for further work-up.
 At [**Hospital1 25**] the patient was found to have ischemic EKG changes 
(exact same T-wave inversions in anterolateral leads), but 
remained asymptomatic.  Two sets of cardiac enzymes were 
negative.  The patient was transferred to Gen Med service for 
further work-up of her lung mass.
Upon admission she had a CXR and repeat chest CT showing a 
necrotic mass occupying the entire right upper lobe and 
occluding the right upper lobe bronchus.  The patient's Abx were 
stopped due to diarrhea, C.diff toxin was sent, and the patient 
was started on Unasyn and flagyl.  A PPD was placed and the 
patient was put on respiratory contact precautions.
The patients reports not feeling well for several months, 
experiencing weakness and occasional fevers.  Her cough produces 
a white sputum; no hemoptysis.  She has SOB at rest.  She also 
reports a 10 lb weight loss over the last month, and decreased 
appetite.  She denies chills, sweats, chest pain, or diarrhea.  
She is a lifetime non-smoker.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known patient lastname 5412**] was originally admitted to CMED for evaluation of her 
ischemic EKG changes.  She was stablized and transferred to 
Medicine for work-up of her lung mass.  She underwent evaluation 
by Thoracic Surgery and on HD 13 underwent an uncomplicated RUL, 
RML, and superior segment of RLL resection with placement of 
chest tubes and JP drain for intercostal flap. AdenoCA of lung 
was found on frozen section. Please see OP report for details.
    Post-operatively she remained in the ICU intubated.  She 
gradually improved and was extubated on POD___.  She was in 
atrial fibrillatin post-operatively and was converted into sinus 
rhythm on POD__, and was maintained on amiodarone.  She was able 
to be transferred to the floor on POD___ and continued to do 
very well.  Her chest tubes were removed on POD__ and her JP 
drian remained.  She eventually was weened off of oxygen and 
ambulated well.  She was able to be dicharged home on POD 12 
with home physical therapy and drain managment services.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evidence of CHF or pneumonia?

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Chest pain.
     
     COMPARISONS:  No comparisons are available.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  AP upright single view of the chest.  Allowing for AP technique,
     the heart is probably within normal limits.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is
     a large mass, which appears to be centered in the lung in the right upper lung
     zone.  It is probably causing some compression of the right main stem
     bronchus, which appears to be narrowed.  The remaining portions of the lung
     fields are clear.  No bone destruction is seen in this radiograph.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large right upper lung zone mass, which could represent a lung
     tumor. Another possibility would be a posterior mediastinal mass.  CT of the
     chest with IV contrast is recommended. Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2664**]
     at the time of the interpretation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Right upper lobe lung mass.  Concern for right mainstem bronchus
     obstruction.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous chest CT at our institution.  The patient has an
     outside chest CT, which is not currently available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images of the chest were obtained with 100
     cc of intravenous Optiray.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large mass occupying the entire right upper lobe and
     obstructing the right upper lobe bronchus.  There is mixed soft tissue
     attenuation and fluid attenuation within this mass, suggesting that portions
     of it are necrotic.  Gas is also present within the mass, which may represent
     either necrotizing infection or residual communication with the bronchial
     tree.  Blood vessels are seen coursing through this mass, the so-called ""CT
     angiogram sign.""  This appearance may represent bronchoalveolar carcinoma with
     associated necrosis, probably secondary to postobstructive pneumonia.
     Alternatively, this may represent an abscess-forming infection such as
     tuberculosis.
     
     In the medial portion of the right middle lobe, there is a 24 x 18 mm
     hypodense opacity intimately associated with bronchovascular tree, which may
     represent a satellite mass or an enlarged intrapulmonary lymph node. In the
     left upper lobe, there is a 3 mm pleural-based nodule, which appears
     nonspecific, and a 3 mm calcified granuloma. There is consolidation of the
     superior segment of the right lower lobe. There is an enlarged lymph node
     associated with the right interlobar artery. There are patchy opacities
     throughout the left lower lobe. There is a precarinal lymph node, measuring 9
     mm in short axis diameter. There is no lymphadenopathy in the axilla or in the
     left hilum. The right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left-sided airways
     are patent to the level of segmental bronchi.  The heart and great vessels
     appear unremarkable. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
     
     There are multiple tiny, less than 5 mm, hypodense liver lesions, which are
     too small to characterize.  There is a 5 mm hypodense lesion in the mid right
     kidney, which is also too small to characterize.  The spleen, visualized
     portions of the pancreas, adrenal glands, and visualized portions of the left
     kidney appear unremarkable.  There is no evidence of bone destruction.
     Scoliosis is noted at the thoracolumbar junction.
                                                                 (Over)

     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2666**] at 11:15 a.m. on [**3418-6-6**].
     Correlation with PPD testing was recommended.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Necrotic mass occupying the entire right upper lobe and occluding the
     right upper lobe bronchus, which may represent a neoplasm such as
     bronchoalveolar carcinoma with necrosis and associated postobstructive
     pneumonia. Alternatively, this may represent an abscess-forming infection,

     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2666**] at 11:15 a.m. on [**3418-6-6**].
     Correlation with PPD testing was recommended.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Necrotic mass occupying the entire right upper lobe and occluding the
     right upper lobe bronchus, which may represent a neoplasm such as
     bronchoalveolar carcinoma with necrosis and associated postobstructive
     pneumonia. Alternatively, this may represent an abscess-forming infection,
     including tuberculosis.
     2.  Satellite necrotic mass or lymph node in the right middle lobe. Enlarged
     right lower lobe intralobar lymph node.
     3.  3 mm pleural-based nodule in the left upper lobe, which appears
     nonspecific.
     4.  Right lower lobe superior segment consolidation.  Patchy consolidations in
     the left lower lobe.

     FINDINGS:  Since the examination dated [**3418-6-5**], the appearance of the
     dense mass-like consolidation in the right upper lobe is similar, although
     internal cavitary lucency is slightly different in configuration.  Narrowing
     of the right main bronchus by hilar mass is again suggested.  The heart size
     and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  New consolidation and volume loss in
     the right lower lobe suggest aspiration of upper lobe contents or blood.  The
     left lung remains clear.

     HISTORY:  79 year old woman with history of abnormal EKG, observe for suspected
     CAD.  
       
     SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a  dose of 0.142 
     milligram/kilogram/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m
     sestamibi was administered IV.  No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes
     were noted. 
       
     INTERPRETATION:  
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT  
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.  
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.  
     This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.  
       
     Left ventricular cavity is normal.  
     Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a moderate reversible defect
     involving the distal anterior wall, distal septum and apex.  
       
     Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  
     The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 68%.  
       
     IMPRESSION:  Moderate reversible perfusion defect involving the distal anterior
     wall, distal septum and apex, most consistent with a distal LAD distribution. 
     Calculated ejection fraction of 68%.  
       
     Results were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2670**] at 5 pm on [**3418-6-11**].

     redemonstrate necrotic consolidated lung in the right upper lobe with a large
     component of organized intraparenchymal fluid in the posterior aspect of the
     right upper lobe.  The appearance is similar to that seen on recent previous
     study.
     
     CT DRAINAGE:
     
     CT GUIDED DRAINAGE LOCALIZATION:  Limited axial CT images were obtained to
     localize the right upper lung parenchyma fluid collection to be drained.
     
     CT GUIDED DRAINAGE GUIDANCE:  CT fluoroscopy was used to guide in insertion of
     a 22-gauge needle within the overlying soft tissues, for eventual guidance
     using trocar technique as well as for instillation of several cc of 1%
     lidocaine.
     
     CT GUIDED CATHETER INSERTION:  A 10 French self locking pigtail catheter was
     inserted and deployed into the right upper lobe lung abscess.  Catheter
     position was confirmed using CT scanning.  The catheter was locked in position
     and secured to the skin with a percutaneous catheter fastener, and left to
     open drainage.
     
     CT GUIDED FLUID ASPIRATION:  Approximately 150 cc of frank pus and
     serosanguineous mucous material was aspirated into the drainage bag.  Samples
     were sent for cytology and microbiology.

     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube, 2 right apical chest tubes, left subclavian
     central line, NG tube, and ET tube are all unchanged.  The degree of the right
     lung expansion and the moderate right effusion are unchanged.  Mild
     cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The crescentic air collection in the right apex
     above the two right chest tubes is unchanged.  Moderate scoliosis is again
     identified.  There is poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm consistent
     with volume loss versus a small/early infiltrate.  Overall, there has been no
     significant interval change.

     lobe lobectomy with chest tube removed, question pneumothorax.
     
     CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
     
     Compared with one day earlier, the chest tube has been removed.  A drain is
     again seen overlying the right chest wall.  There are extensive surgical
     changes on the right, with evidence of volume loss, including slight
     mediastinal shift and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is
     opacification in much of the right apex.  There is residual aerated lung in
     the mid zone.  In addition, some rounded and oblong areas of lucency project
     over the right apex and could represent residual air associated with the right
     apical fluid.  These lucent areas at the right apex are slightly more
     prominent than on the film from one day earlier.  Findings are consistent with
     residual air at the site of pneumonectomy.  The left lung is hyperinflated,
     consistent with COPD,  with scarring and subsegmental atelectasis.  Minimal
     blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  No CHF or significant left-sided
     effusion. No left pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in the amount of air at the right lung apex,
     status post removal of right chest tube.  Otherwise, no significant change
     compared with one day earlier.  The lateral view shows air projecting
     anteriorly, but this may be an artifact of positioning.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: A 79 y.o. woman with lung cancer, staging. 
      
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18   
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was    106
     milligram/deciliter. The area imaged spanned the region from the  skull base  to
       the thigh. 
       
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake.  
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
     There is focal symmetric abnormal uptake of FDG with SUV 4.3-6.4, in bilateral
     supraclavicular areas, corresponding to the muscles. 
      
     The patient is s/p right upper, middle and partial lower lobectomy with
     post-surgical changes and pleural thickening and effusion. Note is made of mild
     FDG uptake along the chest wall on the right, with SUV 2.0-2.4, corresponding to
     the post-surgical changes. 
      
     There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in right anterior apex, with SUV of 6.3,
     worrisome for residual tumor or residual inflammation vs. infection. There is
     focal abnormal uptake of FDG in right anterior and lateral pleura with SUV
     3.0-3.2.  
      
     There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in right pericardial area, with SUV 2.8,
     which may represent pericardial lymph node or residual soft tissue. 
      
     There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in right paratrachea with SUV of 2.9, and
     in the subcarina with SUV of 2.9, which probably correspond to lymph nodes. 
      
     Note is made of focal FDG uptake posterior to trachea at the level of thoracic
     inlet, with SUV 4.4, which may be due to recent intubation. 
      
     There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in mid pelvis, with SUV of 5.2, either
     within or adjacent to small bowel, of unknown etiology. 
      
     There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in C1 vertebral body, with SUV 4.9,
     worrisome for metastasis. Note is made of focal FDG uptake in right posterior
     element of C4, with SUV 2.5, which may due to degeneration, or alternatively,
     small metastasis. There is a sclerotic area in the right ilium, without FDG
     avidity.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 - and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through
     the brain with multiplanar post-gadolinium T1 imaging, diffusion-weighted
     imaging and ADC mapping.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are some foci of increased T2 signal within the
     periventricular white matter, most consistent with chronic microvascular
     ischemic changes.  There is no evidence of an enhancing lesion.  There is no
     mass effect, hydrocephalus, and no midline shift.  There are no areas of slow
     diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.  No abnormal susceptibility artifact
     is identified.  Normal vascular flow voids are present.

     COMPARISON:  [**3418-6-29**].
     
     INDICATION:  Status post partial resection of right lung.  Followup
     thoracotomy.
     
     There is stable postoperative volume loss in the right hemithorax.  A
     moderate-to-large right pleural fluid collection persists, most pronounced at
     the right apex.  The previously present collections of air within the apical
     fluid collection have resolved in the interval.  Linear scarring is noted
     adjacent to surgical chain sutures within the right mid lung region. 
     Left-sided mediastinal contours as well as the cardiac contour on the left are
     within normal limits and stable.  A few calcified granulomas are incidentally
     noted at the left apex, and there is minimal stable interstitial abnormality
     at the left base.  A small left pleural effusion is also stable in the
     interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable right-sided pleural opacities, but interval resolution of
     the loculated collections of gas at the right apex.
     
     Please note that correlative FDG PET study of [**3418-7-29**] reveals that
     a muscle flap contributes in part to the observed right apical opacity on
     CXR.

     INDICATION:  A 79-year-old woman with lung cancer, question thoracic spine
     mets.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**7-29**] PET CT.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet
     through the pubic symphysis without and after the administration of Optiray
     contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained and viewed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  In soft tissue windows, there is a pleural-
     based soft tissue mass in the right apex that may have a portion extending
     into the chest wall.  This corresponds to an area of FDG avidity seen on the
     PET scan.  This area appears to have slightly progressed in the interval.
     There are also two right rib metastases.  In the right lower lobe, there is a
     small effusion.  There is also pleural thickening in the right base that
     likely represents malignancy.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. Besides
     the pleural thickening abutting the mediastinum, there are no definite
     enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.
     
     In the lung windows, there are multiple pulmonary nodules visible in the left
     lung.  There are at least six nodules with the largest in the left lower lobe
     measuring 9 mm in diameter.  These nodules are either larger or newly
     identified from the comparison study and represent progression of disease.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are multiple hypodense lesions in the
     liver that are too small to characterize but likely represent simple cysts.
     All but one of these lesions are visible on prior studies and are unchanged.
     The remaining lesion that is not visible was not imaged.  The gallbladder is
     normal.  The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal.  The right
     kidney contains a small 7-mm hypodense lesion that is too small to
     characterize but likely represents a simple cyst.  The left kidney is normal.
     There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The large and
     small bowel loops are of normal caliber.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum and sigmoid colon are
     unremarkable.  The uterus is normal size with no adnexal masses identified.
     There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
                                                                 (Over)

     CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, PELVIS
     
     INDICATION:  A 79-year-old woman with lung cancer, question thoracic spine
     mets.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**7-29**] PET CT.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet
     through the pubic symphysis without and after the administration of Optiray
     contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained and viewed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  In soft tissue windows, there is a pleural-
     based soft tissue mass in the right apex that may have a portion extending
     into the chest wall.  This corresponds to an area of FDG avidity seen on the
     PET scan.  This area appears to have slightly progressed in the interval.
     There are also two right rib metastases.  In the right lower lobe, there is a
     small effusion.  There is also pleural thickening in the right base that
     likely represents malignancy.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. Besides
     the pleural thickening abutting the mediastinum, there are no definite
     enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum.  The heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable.
     
     In the lung windows, there are multiple pulmonary nodules visible in the left
     lung.  There are at least six nodules with the largest in the left lower lobe
     measuring 9 mm in diameter.  These nodules are either larger or newly
     identified from the comparison study and represent progression of disease.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are multiple hypodense lesions in the
     liver that are too small to characterize but likely represent simple cysts.
     All but one of these lesions are visible on prior studies and are unchanged.
     The remaining lesion that is not visible was not imaged.  The gallbladder is
     normal.  The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal.  The right
     kidney contains a small 7-mm hypodense lesion that is too small to
     characterize but likely represents a simple cyst.  The left kidney is normal.
     There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The large and
     small bowel loops are of normal caliber.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum and sigmoid colon are
     unremarkable.  The uterus is normal size with no adnexal masses identified.
     There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
                                                                 (Over)

     to evaluate for brain mets.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images were obtained from the skull base to
     the vertex with the administration of IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison was made to MR head from [**3418-7-29**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass
     effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.  No enhancing
     lesions are identified.  There is a hypoattenuation identified within the
     periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with
     chronic microvascular ischemia.  Osseous windows reveal a lucent lesion in the
     diploe of the right frontal bone, which corresponds to an area of

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  79-year-old woman with recently diagnosed bronchoalveolar lung cancer
     (BAC).   Evaluate for bony metastases.  
       
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and
     posterior projections. There is a focal area of increased tracer uptake seen at
     the approximate level of T1 that corresponds to FDG avid lesion seen on prior 
     PET-CT, concerning for metastasis.   
       
     There are multiple areas of increased focal uptake seen in the right chest wall
     which may correspond to post surgical changes, as seen on prior PET-CT.   
       
     There is also bilateral increased tracer uptake in the shoulders, with slightly
     greater uptake on the left that may represent degenerative changes, but
     metastatic disease cannot be ruled out. 
      
     Severe scoliosis is seen with leftward convexity and apex in the upper lumbar
     spine.  
       
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion.  
       
     IMPRESSION:  
       1. Increased tracer uptake at the approximate level of T1 that, with given
     history of lung cancer, is concerning for metastatic disease. Corraborated with
     PET-CT.  
       2. Focal areas of increased uptake in the right chest wall that may correspond
     to post surgical changes. 
       3. Left greater than right increased shoulder uptake, which may represent
     degenerative changes, but a metastatic lesion cannot be ruled out. 
       4. Severe scoliosis, as described above.

     HISTORY:  79-year-old woman with atlantoaxial dissociation seen on recent head
     CT presents for follow-up.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Two lateral flexion views and a lateral extension view of the cervical spine
     were obtained and compared with CT of the head, [**3418-9-18**].  On the
     flexion views, there is approximately 4-mm atlantoaxial dissociation, which
     corrects to the normal range on the extension view.  No fracture is
     identified.  There is extensive degenerative change of the cervical spine with
     anterior osteophyte formation as well as straightening and reversal of the
     cervical lordosis.  Degenerative disc disease is noted at the C3-C4 and C4-C5
     levels.  The vertebral body heights are preserved.  There is 2 mm of
     anterolisthesis of C5 over C6.  Surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  4-mm atlantoaxial dissociation on flexion consistent with
     ligamentous laxity.  Extensive degenerative change of the cervical spine.
     Slight anterolisthesis of C5 over C6.

     INDICATION:  80-year-old woman with lung cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the upper abdomen were obtained
     without the administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  Contiguous axial images of
     the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained with the administration of IV
     contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**], 150 cc of Optiray.  Multiplanar reformation images are
     reconstructed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison was made with a prior CT study dated [**3418-9-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CHEST:  Again note is made of right apical mass with heterogeneous enhancement
     measuring 6.5 x 6.2 cm, increased in size compared to the prior study,
     likely representing lung cancer mentioned in the history.  Note is made of
     irregular pleural thickening with enhancement in the right thorax, associated
     with effusion and atelectasis, probably representing combination of effusion
     and pleural metastatic disease, increased compared to the prior study.  The
     mass and pleural metastasis cannot be clearly delineated from the right chest
     wall. Note is made of low-density soft tissue masses surrounding the right
     lower ribs, increased compared to the prior study, likely representing bone
     metastasis with soft tissue component.  There is increased soft tissue
     involving the mediastinum, also likely representing combination of lung cancer
     and lymph nodes. Pericardial thickening and increased pericardial effusion is
     seen.  The right lower lobe bronchus is narrowed by the surrounding soft
     tissue, with possible endobronchial component, however, the evaluation of
     endobronchial component is limited on this CT scan.  In the lung window, again
     note is made of multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules with ill-defined
     borders, increased in size and number compared to the prior study,
     consistent with metastases.  In the right lung, again note is made of
     increased interlobular septal thickening and ground glass opacity,possibly
     related to lymphangitic spread of the tumor in this patient with advanced lung
     cancer. Again note is made of low-density nodule in the right thyroid gland,
     unchanged compared to the prior study.
     
     ABDOMEN:  Again note is made of low-density focal lesion in the segment IV
     adjacent to the falciform ligament, increased in size compared to the prior
     study, representing liver metastasis.  Note is made of other tiny low-density
     areas in bilateral lobes of the liver, unchanged compared to the prior study,
                                                                 (Over)

     which are too small to be characterized.  Gallbladder is normal without
     evidence of stone.  Spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are
     unremarkable.  Again note is made of small right renal cyst.  The visualized
     portion of large and small intestines is within normal limits.  No ascites. No
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     PELVIS:  The visualized portion of large and small intestines is within normal
     limits.  No ascites.  No lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The patient has marked scoliosis and degenerative changes of
     the lumbar spine.  There is asymmetry of the thoracic cage, probably due to
     prior surgery.  As described above, there are multiple rib metastases with
     soft tissue component on the right.
     
     Multiplanar reformation images confirm the above finding.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Large heterogeneous right apical mass with involvement of mediastinal
     lymph nodes and diffuse pleural metastases associated with atelectasis,
     representing worsening lung cancer.
     2.  Multiple  soft tissue masses surrounding the right lower ribs likely
     representing worsening bone metastases.
     3.  Increased interlobular septal thickening in the right lung, worrisome for
     lymphangitic spread of the tumor.
     4.  Increased pericardial effusion and thickening.
     5.  Increased number and the size of multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules
     in bilateral lungs.
     6.  Increase in size of right liver lesion, probably representing metastasis.
     7.  Narrowing of the right lower lobe bronchus by surrounding soft tissue
     mass, with possible endobronchial component as described above.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  80-year-old woman with lung cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the upper abdomen were obtained
     without the administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  Contiguous axial images of
     the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained with the administration of IV
     contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**], 150 cc of Optiray.  Multiplanar reformation images are
     reconstructed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison was made with a prior CT study dated [**3418-9-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CHEST:  Again note is made of right apical mass with heterogeneous enhancement
     measuring 6.5 x 6.2 cm, increased in size compared to the prior study,
     likely representing lung cancer mentioned in the history.  Note is made of
     irregular pleural thickening with enhancement in the right thorax, associated
     with effusion and atelectasis, probably representing combination of effusion
     and pleural metastatic disease, increased compared to the prior study.  The
     mass and pleural metastasis cannot be clearly delineated from the right chest
     wall. Note is made of low-density soft tissue masses surrounding the right
     lower ribs, increased compared to the prior study, likely representing bone
     metastasis with soft tissue component.  There is increased soft tissue
     involving the mediastinum, also likely representing combination of lung cancer
     and lymph nodes. Pericardial thickening and increased pericardial effusion is
     seen.  The right lower lobe bronchus is narrowed by the surrounding soft
     tissue, with possible endobronchial component, however, the evaluation of
     endobronchial component is limited on this CT scan.  In the lung window, again
     note is made of multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules with ill-defined
     borders, increased in size and number compared to the prior study,
     consistent with metastases.  In the right lung, again note is made of
     increased interlobular septal thickening and ground glass opacity,possibly
     related to lymphangitic spread of the tumor in this patient with advanced lung
     cancer. Again note is made of low-density nodule in the right thyroid gland,
     unchanged compared to the prior study.
     
     ABDOMEN:  Again note is made of low-density focal lesion in the segment IV
     adjacent to the falciform ligament, increased in size compared to the prior
     study, representing liver metastasis.  Note is made of other tiny low-density
     areas in bilateral lobes of the liver, unchanged compared to the prior study,
                                                                 (Over)

     which are too small to be characterized.  Gallbladder is normal without
     evidence of stone.  Spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are
     unremarkable.  Again note is made of small right renal cyst.  The visualized
     portion of large and small intestines is within normal limits.  No ascites. No
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     PELVIS:  The visualized portion of large and small intestines is within normal
     limits.  No ascites.  No lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The patient has marked scoliosis and degenerative changes of
     the lumbar spine.  There is asymmetry of the thoracic cage, probably due to
     prior surgery.  As described above, there are multiple rib metastases with
     soft tissue component on the right.
     
     Multiplanar reformation images confirm the above finding.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Large heterogeneous right apical mass with involvement of mediastinal
     lymph nodes and diffuse pleural metastases associated with atelectasis,
     representing worsening lung cancer.
     2.  Multiple  soft tissue masses surrounding the right lower ribs likely
     representing worsening bone metastases.
     3.  Increased interlobular septal thickening in the right lung, worrisome for
     lymphangitic spread of the tumor.
     4.  Increased pericardial effusion and thickening.
     5.  Increased number and the size of multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules
     in bilateral lungs.
     6.  Increase in size of right liver lesion, probably representing metastasis.
     7.  Narrowing of the right lower lobe bronchus by surrounding soft tissue
     mass, with possible endobronchial component as described above.
