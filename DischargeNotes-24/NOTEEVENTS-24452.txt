FIVE VIEWS, RIGHT FEMUR: Again seen is a comminuted right 
intertrochanteric fracture. The right hip joint is intact. The 
remainder of the femur is unremarkable. There is a small right 
knee joint effusion.

NON-CONTRAST CERVICAL SPINE CT: No prior for comparison. There 
is a fracture at the base of C2 dens suggestive of type II 
fracture. There is approximately 3 mm of posterior subluxation 
of the dens relative to C2 body. The remainder of the vertebral 
bodies of the cervical spine appear intact, though there are 
laminectomy defects at C3 through C5. Complete loss of disc 
height at C2-3 through C6-7, with bone-on- bone appearance at 
these levels. There is very slight retrolisthesis (grade I) of 
C5 on C6 and grade I anterolisthesis of C6 on C7, with vacuum 
disc phenomenon at C6-7. Exaggerated lordosis centered at C6. 
Some prominence of soft tissue is seen anterior to C2, 
consistent with the appearance of acute fracture. Lung apices 
show no emphysematous changes. Imaged portions of the mastoid 
air cells are clear.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2716-4-1**] 2:52 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: eval for injury 
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old s/p fall 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for injury 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post fall, now chest pain.

TECHNIQUE: MD[**MD Number 2395**] used to obtain contiguous axial images from 
the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the 
administration of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats 
were also obtained.

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are moderate dependent 
atelectatic changes. Linear atelectasis is seen at left lung 
base. There is increased interstitial markings, which, in this 
case, probably indicate a degree of mild fluid overload. An 
ill-defined 1-cm nodule is seen in the anterolateral right upper 
lobe. A small rounded 3-mm pulmonary nodule is seen more 
inferiorly in the right middle lobe. There are shotty 
mediastinal lymph[**MD Number 298**] and a calcified lymph node in the right 
paratracheal region, measuring 13 mm. Other lymph[**MD Number 298**] are not 
pathologically enlarged. The aorta is normal in caliber, without 
evidence of dissection. There are coronary vascular 
calcifications, most notably in the left anterior descending and 
circumflex arteries. No pericardial effusion is present.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: No intra-abdominal free fluid is 
seen. There is no free air. The liver, spleen, kidneys, 
pancreas, and left adrenal all appear to be within normal 
limits. A tiny 7-mm low-density lesion is seen in the adrenal 
gland, of uncertain significance. The gallbladder is not 
visualized; the extra-hepatic common bile duct appears 
prominent, measuring approximately 1-cm in diameter. The aorta 
is normal in caliber, with mural calcifications. The major 
arteries are patent. There is some atheromatous plaque in the 
aorta, but there is no evidence of dissection. In the right 
lower quadrant, there is a 23 x 18 mm soft tissue lesion with a 
central calcification. The appendix is not visualized. Please 
note that this is non- oral contrast scan, and therefore is 
limited in terms of evaluation of the bowel. The sigmoid 
contains diverticulosis, without diverticulitis. The bladder 
contains a Foley with non-dependent air. Distal ureters appear 
unremarkable. Prostate appears slightly enlarged. No free air or 
free fluid is seen in the pelvis.

There is a chronic-appearing wedge configuration of T7 and T8, 
without evidence of retropulsion of fragments into the spinal 
canal. There are degenerative changes throughout, with loss of 
disc height at several levels including L3-4 and L4-5. L5-S1 
shows mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5. There is a comminuted 
fracture through the right proximal femur.

Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings 
above.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection. Coronary vascular 
calcifications noted.

2. Proximal right femoral fracture.

3. 2.3 cm soft tissue mass in right lower quadrant with single 
large calcification which may represent appendicolith. Followup 
study in 3 months recommended to ensure stability.

4. Mild cardiac failure.

5. 3-mm nodule and ill-defined 1-cm nodule in right upper lobe. 
In the absence of known primary malignancy, followup CT scan can 
be obtained in one year to ensure stability.

6. Prominence of biliary system probably related to absence of 
gallbladder.

7. Calcified mediastinal lymph node which may represent prior 
tuberculosis.

8. Emphysematous changes of the lungs.

Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5399**] by telephone 
at 4 o'clock p.m., [**2716-4-1**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was evaluated in the emergency room and found to 
have a right intertrochanteric hip fracture and a C2 dens type 
fracture.  He was admitted to the trauma service.  The patient 
was seen by medicine preoperatively for clearance.  He was taken 
to the operating room on [**2716-4-2**] for a gamma nail.  See 
operative note for details.  He tolerated the procedure well.  
He was extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable 
condition.  Once stable in the PACU he was transferred to the 
floor on the orthopedic service.  On the floor he did well.  A 
HALO was placed by the orthopedic spine service on [**2716-4-3**] for 
management of his C2 fracture.  He tolerated this well.  

He was evaluated by physical therapy and progressed well.  His 
pain was well controlled.  His labs and vital signs remained 
stable.  His hospital course was otherwise without incident.  He 
is being discharged today in stable condition.

     INDICATION:  Status post fall, now chest pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the thoracic
     inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of IV contrast.  Coronal
     and sagittal reformats were also obtained.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are moderate dependent atelectatic changes.
     Linear atelectasis is seen at left lung base.  There is increased interstitial
     markings, which, in this case, probably indicate a degree of mild fluid
     overload.  An ill-defined 1-cm nodule is seen in the anterolateral right upper
     lobe.  A small rounded 3-mm pulmonary nodule is seen more inferiorly in the
     right middle lobe.  There are shotty mediastinal lymph nodes and a calcified
     lymph node in the right paratracheal region, measuring 13 mm.  Other lymph
     nodes are not pathologically enlarged.  The aorta is normal in caliber,
     without evidence of dissection.  There are coronary vascular calcifications,
     most notably in the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  No
     pericardial effusion is present.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  No intra-abdominal free fluid is seen.  There is
     no free air.  The liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, and left adrenal all
     appear to be within normal limits.  A tiny 7-mm low-density lesion is seen in
     the adrenal gland, of uncertain significance.  The gallbladder is not
     visualized; the extra-hepatic common bile duct appears prominent, measuring
     approximately 1-cm in diameter.  The aorta is normal in caliber, with mural
     calcifications.  The major arteries are patent.  There is some atheromatous
     plaque in the aorta, but there is no evidence of dissection.  In the right
     lower quadrant, there is a 23 x 18 mm soft tissue lesion with a central
     calcification.  The appendix is not visualized.  Please note that this is non-
     oral contrast scan, and therefore is limited in terms of evaluation of the
     bowel.  The sigmoid contains diverticulosis, without diverticulitis.  The
     bladder contains a Foley with non-dependent air.  Distal ureters appear
     unremarkable.  Prostate appears slightly enlarged.  No free air or free fluid
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     is seen in the pelvis.
     
     There is a chronic-appearing wedge configuration of T7 and T8, without
     evidence of retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal.  There are
     degenerative changes throughout, with loss of disc height at several levels
     including L3-4 and L4-5.  L5-S1 shows mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5.
     There is a comminuted fracture through the right proximal femur.
     
     Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings above.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of aortic dissection.  Coronary vascular calcifications noted.
     
     2.  Proximal right femoral fracture.
     
     3.  2.3 cm soft tissue mass in right lower quadrant with single large
     calcification which may represent appendicolith.  Followup study in 3 months
     recommended to ensure stability.
     
     4.  Mild cardiac failure.
     
     5.  3-mm nodule and ill-defined 1-cm nodule in right upper lobe. In the
     absence of known primary malignancy, followup CT scan can be obtained in one
     year to ensure stability.
     
     6.  Prominence of biliary system probably related to absence of gallbladder.
     
     7.  Calcified mediastinal lymph node which may represent prior tuberculosis.
     
     8.  Emphysematous changes of the lungs.
     
     Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2651**] by telephone at 4 o'clock
     p.m., [**2716-4-1**].
