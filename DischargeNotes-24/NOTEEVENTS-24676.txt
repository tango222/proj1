Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Prochlorperazine / Metoclopramide / Cephalosporins / Penicillins
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 497**] 
Chief Complaint:
Nephrostomy tube fell out.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Replacement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes [**4-8**]
Central line placement [**4-8**]
 
History of Present Illness:
81 year old female with remote history of cervical cancer status 
post XRT with resultant vesicovaginal/rectovesical/rectovaginal 
fistulae and bilateral nephrostomy tubes who was sent to [**Hospital1 25**] 
from [**Hospital3 174**] after her nephrostomy tube fell out.  

Of note, she has had 2 recent [**Hospital1 25**] hospitalizations, both for 
urinary tract infections with ESBL Klebsiella.  During her last 
hospitalization from [**3436-2-28**] through [**3436-3-15**], she was treated 
with a 2 week course of meropenem, as well as flagyl for concern 
for C. Difficile given persistent fevers.  She had a CT abd that 
demonstrated the aforementioned fistulas, a sacral decub, and 
thickening of the right iliopsoas muscle that may represent 
early inflammatory changes secondary to an infectious process 
ascending from the pelvis.  During this hospitalization the 
patient refused many interventions/diagnostic studies, including 
replacement of her nephrostomy tubes, and repeat CT scan to 
further assess the concern for psoas abscess.  She was evaluated 
by the Gyn Onc as well as colorectal surgery services for 
possible diverting colostomy, but was felt to be a poor surgical 
candidate by both services.  After completion of her antibiotic 
courses ([**3-11**]) she was discharged to [**Hospital3 174**] with plans 
to follow up with ID, however she missed her appointment.  She 
was restarted on imipenem at [**Hospital3 **] from [**Date range (1) 5846**] 
presumably for a repeat urine culture with Klebsiella, although 
that data is not available.
  
Per her NH notes, she was sent to [**Hospital1 25**] yesterday because her 
nephrostomy tube fell out.  Of note, a urine culture at [**Hospital 5847**] on [**4-4**] again grew out ESBL Klebsiella; she was started on 
imipenem there on [**4-7**] when the culture results became 
available.  Of note, she has also had a PICC line in place, of 
unclear duration.
 
In our ED, the pt was febrile to 101.2, with initial HR 100, BP 
136/80.  She was given Imipenem 500 mg IV x 1 and vancomycin 1 g 
IV x 1.  She received Ativan 0.5 mg IV at around 1 a.m., and 
again at 4 a.m.  Shortly thereafter her BP dropped to 88/43.  
She subsequently received 4L IVF with minimal blood pressure 
response.  At around 10 a.m. she was started on a dopamine drip. 
 She had a L SC central line placed.  Dopamine was subsequently 
changed to levophed.    
 
Past Medical History:
1. Cervical Cancer 30 yrs ago, treated with XRT. Known 
vesicovaginal fistula, with recently discovered rectovaginal 
fistula, and rectovesical fistula. Per d/c summary, she is a 
poor surgical candidate for repair of this, but could consider a 
diverting colostomy done endoscopically, however patient did not 
want any further invasive procedures.  Status post bilateral 
nephrostomy tubes which per notes were last placed [**3436-2-11**].  
2. Type 2 DM  
3. Hypothyroidism  
4. History of VRE, MRSA UTIs  
5. Bipolar d/o  
6. Anemia of chronic disease, baseline around 28.
7. delirium
 
Social History:
Living at [**Hospital3 174**] currently.  Daughter [**Name (NI) **] is HCP.

 
Family History:
Non-contributory 
 
Physical Exam:

I/O:  4000/1600
Gen:  Elderly female, resting comfortably in bed, conversant, 
responding appropriately to all questions.
HEENT: Dry MM.  Pupils equal.
Neck:  Jugular veins collapse with inspiration.
Lungs: CTA anteriorly.  
Cor:  Regularly irregular rhythm, [**12-28**] harsh systolic murmur 
heard best at apex.  No extension to carotids.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**3436-4-9**] 6:50 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: Please re-evaluate psoas area for abscess, or other 
intra-ab
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman with bilat nephrostomies, 
rectovaginal/rectovesicle/vaginovesicle fistulae, with recurrent 
Klebsiella UTIs, fever while on meropenem, prev CT w/ ?psoas 
collection, now s/p course of meropenem. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please re-evaluate psoas area for abscess, or other 
intra-abdominal abscess. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 80-year-old female with bilateral nephrostomy tubes 
due to rectovaginal/rectovesical/vaginovesical fistulae. A prior 
CT mentioned possible right psoas fluid collection. Reevaluate.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast dated [**3436-1-30**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed 
following the administration of 130 cc of intravenous Optiray. 
Nonionic contrast was administered per protocol. Coronal and 
sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Dependent 
changes are seen within bilateral lung bases. The liver enhances 
normally without focal nodules or masses. The gallbladder is 
collapsed. Stable gallstones within the distal CBD are again 
noted. The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenals glands are 
unremarkable.

Nephrostomy tubes are seen in the kidneys bilaterally, 
terminating within the proximal ureters. The kidneys enhance 
symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis. There has been 
interval placement of a gastrostomy tube. The abdominal loops of 
large and small bowel are normal in caliber and contour. There 
is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no 
free air and no free fluid.

CT PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A large amount 
of stool is present within the urinary bladder. Stool is again 
seen within the vagina. There is marked thickening of the 
urinary bladder. Abnormal soft tissue stranding in the presacral 
space consistent with inflammatory change is unchanged since the 
prior study. The right iliopsoas muscle is somewhat 
asymmetrically larger than the left, but stable since prior 
exam. No fluid collection is identified. Stable subcutaneous 
inflammatory changes posterior to the sacrum are again noted, 
possibly relating to a decubitus ulcer in this location. There 
is no adjacent bony erosion.

BONE WINDOWS: A fixation screw is seen within the right proximal 
femur. A generalized mottled appearance of the bones is again 
noted, appearing unchanged since the prior exam.

Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial 
findings. MPR value grade 2.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged interval appearance of asymmetrically enlarged 
right iliopsoas muscle, without definite fluid collection or 
significant surrounding inflammatory change.

2. Stable interval appearance of stool within the urinary 
bladder and vagina consistent with patient's known rectovesical 
and likely rectovaginal fistulae. The appearance and small 
surrounding fluid are unchanged since prior exam.

3. Unchanged appearance of the subcutaneous tissues posterior to 
the sacrum without adjacent bony erosions. These may be related 
to a sacral decubitus ulcer.

4. Choledocholithiasis without biliary dilatation.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old female with recurrent ESBL Klebsiella UTIs, most 
recently with UCx from [**4-4**] with same organism, presenting after 
nephrostomy tube dislodgement, with hypotension in ED following 
Ativan, which resolved within an hour of arriving in the MICU.

MICU COURSE:  
#)  Hypotension:  The patient was not hypotensive on arrival, 
and the hypotension was temporally related to the ativan doses 
given in ED.  Nevertheless, she also was febrile, with 
leukocytosis and tachycardia, meeting criteria for sepsis with a 
suspected source given her recently positive urine culture for 
ESBL Klebsiella.  The patient was started on meropenem, and 
levophed was quickly weaned off within an hour of arriving to 
the unit.  CVP was persistently [**5-30**], with MAPs around 60 and 
SBP around 100, however the patient was making large amounts of 
urine and mentating well.  On review of the record, it seems 
that her SBP normally runs around 100.  On the morning after 
admission to the ICU, [**11-25**] blood culture bottles grew out gram 
positive cocci in pairs and chainsthat turned out to be coag neg 
staph.  She was therefore also started on vancomycin for a total 
course of 10d. Her PICC line had been removed on arrival to the 
ICU the evening prior shortly after her central line had been 
placed. Central line was removed and PICC placed after stable, 
afebrile, with negative survelence cultures.

#) Urinary tract infection:  Her urine culture from [**Location (un) **] on 
[**4-4**] grew recurrent ESBL Klebsiella.  Given that patient has a 
rectovesical fistula, she will likely never clear this organism. 
 She was restarted on meropenem.  She also may have a psoas 
abscess as indicated on prior CT scan (pt. had previously 
refused repeat CT scan), therefore a CT of her abdomen was 
repeated during this admission which demonstrated no abscess. 
She will be continued on meropenum for a 2 wk course.

#) Nephrostomy tube dislodgement:  Her L nephrostomy tube was 
replaced by IR shortly after arrival in the MICU.  She also had 
her R nephrostomy tube changed as it was due.  Her urine output 
was clear and light yellow subsequently.

#) Tachycardia:  She was tachycardic initially secondary to her 
fever and hypotension.  Subsequently her pulse consistently 
ranged from 90-110.  On tele she had very frequent PACs as the 
etiology.  A TSH was normal. Resolved prior to discharge.

#) ST depressions on EKG:  She had ST depressions in V3-V5 while 
her rate was 120 in the setting of hypotension which 
subsequently resolved on repeat EKG after hydration.  She likely 
had some rate related demand ischemia.  3 sets of cardiac 
enzymes were flat.  
.
#) C-diff positive - ON meropenum. toxin assay positive. Started 
on flagyl. WIll complete a three week course (1 wk longer than 
meropenum).
.
#) Sacral decubitus:  Her sacral decubitus ulcer appeared to 
have a purulent base and plastic surgery was consulted for 
repeat evaluation. The recommended woulnd care, increased 
nutritional support, and accuzyme to area.

#) Type 2 DM: Checked finger sticks QID. Diet controlled so 
finger sticks stopped.
  
#) Hypothyroidism:  Continued outpatient levothyroxine.  TSH 
normal.
  
#) Bipolar disorder:  Continued zyprexa QHS. 
  
#) FEN:  She ate a regular diet while in house, without 
consistency modification.

#) Code:  Status was confirmed as DNR/DNI with daughter, 
although she is OK with central line and pressors.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 y/o F w/bilateral neph tubes, left one fell out last night in nursing home, 
      right one needs to be changed
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please replace left nephrostomy tube, please change right nephrostomy tube      
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  81-year-old woman with bilateral nephrostomy tubes
     placed, left tube has fallen out recently, needs left nephrostomy tube
     replacement and right nephrostomy tube exchange.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient's family, written
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed prone on the
     angiographic table.  A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the
     patient's name, procedure, and the site.  The bilateral flank and right
     preexisting nephrostomy tube were prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local anesthesia on the left
     side around the preexisting incision site.  A 0.018 Glidewire was used to
     advance through the preexisting track which was successful.  A 4 French
     dilator was then placed over the wire.  Contrast was injected through this
     dilator which demonstrated the tip was within the renal pelvis.  There is left
     side hydronephrosis and hydroureter.  The [**Last Name (un) 767**] guide wire was then placed
     through the sheath and the sheath was removed.  A 10 French nephrostomy tube
     was then placed over the wire with the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis.
     Contrast was injected through the tube which demonstrated appropriate
     position.  The tube was connected with an external drainage bag and secured
     with skin with sutures.
     
     5 cc of 1% lidocaine was then applied around the right preexisting nephrostomy
     tube.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] guide wire was advanced through the catheter and the
     catheter was removed.  A new 10 French nephrostomy tube was then placed over
     the wire with the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis.  Contrast injected
     through the catheter which demonstrated appropriate position.  The catheter
     was connected with an external drainage bag and secured with skin with

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  81-year-old woman with bilateral nephrostomy tubes
     placed, left tube has fallen out recently, needs left nephrostomy tube
     replacement and right nephrostomy tube exchange.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2**] [**Name (STitle) 3**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient's family, written
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed prone on the
     angiographic table.  A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the
     patient's name, procedure, and the site.  The bilateral flank and right
     preexisting nephrostomy tube were prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local anesthesia on the left
     side around the preexisting incision site.  A 0.018 Glidewire was used to
     advance through the preexisting track which was successful.  A 4 French
     dilator was then placed over the wire.  Contrast was injected through this
     dilator which demonstrated the tip was within the renal pelvis.  There is left
     side hydronephrosis and hydroureter.  The [**Last Name (un) 767**] guide wire was then placed
     through the sheath and the sheath was removed.  A 10 French nephrostomy tube
     was then placed over the wire with the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis.
     Contrast was injected through the tube which demonstrated appropriate
     position.  The tube was connected with an external drainage bag and secured
     with skin with sutures.
     
     5 cc of 1% lidocaine was then applied around the right preexisting nephrostomy
     tube.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] guide wire was advanced through the catheter and the
     catheter was removed.  A new 10 French nephrostomy tube was then placed over
     the wire with the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis.  Contrast injected
     through the catheter which demonstrated appropriate position.  The catheter
     was connected with an external drainage bag and secured with skin with

     [**Name (STitle) 457**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient's family, written
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed prone on the
     angiographic table.  A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the
     patient's name, procedure, and the site.  The bilateral flank and right
     preexisting nephrostomy tube were prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local anesthesia on the left
     side around the preexisting incision site.  A 0.018 Glidewire was used to
     advance through the preexisting track which was successful.  A 4 French
     dilator was then placed over the wire.  Contrast was injected through this
     dilator which demonstrated the tip was within the renal pelvis.  There is left
     side hydronephrosis and hydroureter.  The [**Last Name (un) 767**] guide wire was then placed
     through the sheath and the sheath was removed.  A 10 French nephrostomy tube
     was then placed over the wire with the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis.
     Contrast was injected through the tube which demonstrated appropriate
     position.  The tube was connected with an external drainage bag and secured
     with skin with sutures.
     
     5 cc of 1% lidocaine was then applied around the right preexisting nephrostomy
     tube.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] guide wire was advanced through the catheter and the
     catheter was removed.  A new 10 French nephrostomy tube was then placed over
     the wire with the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis.  Contrast injected
     through the catheter which demonstrated appropriate position.  The catheter
     was connected with an external drainage bag and secured with skin with
     sutures.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  80-year-old female with bilateral nephrostomy tubes due to
     rectovaginal/rectovesical/vaginovesical fistulae.  A prior CT mentioned
     possible right psoas fluid collection.  Reevaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast dated [**3436-1-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following the
     administration of 130 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was
     administered per protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
     obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Dependent changes are seen
     within bilateral lung bases.  The liver enhances normally without focal
     nodules or masses.  The gallbladder is collapsed.  Stable gallstones within
     the distal CBD are again noted.  The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenals
     glands are unremarkable.
     
     Nephrostomy tubes are seen in the kidneys bilaterally, terminating within the
     proximal ureters.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically without evidence of
     hydronephrosis.  There has been interval placement of a gastrostomy tube.  The
     abdominal loops of large and small bowel are normal in caliber and contour.
     There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  There is no free
     air and no free fluid.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A large amount of stool is
     present within the urinary bladder.  Stool is again seen within the vagina.
     There is marked thickening of the urinary bladder.  Abnormal soft tissue
     stranding in the presacral space consistent with inflammatory change is
     unchanged since the prior study.  The right iliopsoas muscle is somewhat
     asymmetrically larger than the left, but stable since prior exam.  No fluid
     collection is identified.  Stable subcutaneous inflammatory changes posterior
     to the sacrum are again noted, possibly relating to a decubitus ulcer in this
     location.  There is no adjacent bony erosion.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  81-year-old female with recurrent urinary tract infections,
     bilateral nephrostomy tubes, with long-term need for intravenous antibiotics
     and no intravenous access.
     
     PROCEDURE:  PICC line placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4961**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3481**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 282**] [**Name (STitle) 4**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the
     Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURES/FINDINGS:  Using ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was
     identified and confirmed to be compressible and patent.  The right arm was
     prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Using ultrasound
     guidance, the right basilic vein was entered with a 21-gauge introducer
     needle.  Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous
     access documenting vessel patency and placement of catheter.  A 0.018
     guidewire was passed through the needle into the superior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  Based
     on the markings wire, a length of 30 cm was found to be appropriate for the
     PICC.  The PICC was trimmed to this length and passed over the wire with the
     tip in the superior vena cava.  A final fluoroscopic image obtained confirmed
     the tip positioned in the SVC.  The catheter was secured to the skin using a
     StatLock device and covered with sterile Tegaderm.  The single port flushed
     easily.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a single-lumen 30-cm PICC via the right
     basilic vein terminating in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready for
     use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  81-year-old female with recurrent urinary tract infections,
     bilateral nephrostomy tubes, with long-term need for intravenous antibiotics
     and no intravenous access.
     
     PROCEDURE:  PICC line placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4961**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3481**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 282**] [**Name (STitle) 4**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the
     Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURES/FINDINGS:  Using ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was
     identified and confirmed to be compressible and patent.  The right arm was
     prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Using ultrasound
     guidance, the right basilic vein was entered with a 21-gauge introducer
     needle.  Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous
     access documenting vessel patency and placement of catheter.  A 0.018
     guidewire was passed through the needle into the superior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  Based
     on the markings wire, a length of 30 cm was found to be appropriate for the
     PICC.  The PICC was trimmed to this length and passed over the wire with the
     tip in the superior vena cava.  A final fluoroscopic image obtained confirmed
     the tip positioned in the SVC.  The catheter was secured to the skin using a
     StatLock device and covered with sterile Tegaderm.  The single port flushed
     easily.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a single-lumen 30-cm PICC via the right
     basilic vein terminating in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready for
     use.

     INDICATION: Urinary obstructions secondary to XRT from cervical cancer.  The
     right percutaneous nephrostomy tube had fallen out at the nursing home.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4964**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Signed and informed consent was obtained from the patient's
     daughter.  A pre-procedure timeout was performed to verify the patient's
     identifying information.  The patient was placed prone on the angiography
     table and the pre-existing nephrostomy tube and nephrostomy catheter site were
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
     
     1% lidocaine as well as lidocaine jelly were used for local anesthesia.  A
     0.018 Glidewire was used to advance through the pre-existing tract along the
     right flank.  A 4 French dilator was then placed over the wire.  Contrast was
     hand injected through this dilator which demonstrated the tip in the renal
     pelvis and a percutaneous nephrostogram was performed which demonstrated
     continued obstruction. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 767**] guide wire and subsequently a 10 French
     nephrostomy tube was placed over the wire with a pigtail formed within the
     right renal pelvis. The catheter was then connected to bag drainage and
     sutured in place.
     
     A tube nephrostogram was performed through the pre-existing catheter within
     the left flank which showed non- opacification of the distal ureter.  A 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was advanced through the catheter and the old catheter was
     removed. A new, 10 French nephrostomy tube was then placed over the wire with
     the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis. Contrast injected through the catheter
     demonstrated appropriate position. The catheter was connected to an external
     drainage bag and secured to the skin with sutures and a StatLock.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.

     INDICATION: Urinary obstructions secondary to XRT from cervical cancer.  The
     right percutaneous nephrostomy tube had fallen out at the nursing home.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4964**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Signed and informed consent was obtained from the patient's
     daughter.  A pre-procedure timeout was performed to verify the patient's
     identifying information.  The patient was placed prone on the angiography
     table and the pre-existing nephrostomy tube and nephrostomy catheter site were
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
     
     1% lidocaine as well as lidocaine jelly were used for local anesthesia.  A
     0.018 Glidewire was used to advance through the pre-existing tract along the
     right flank.  A 4 French dilator was then placed over the wire.  Contrast was
     hand injected through this dilator which demonstrated the tip in the renal
     pelvis and a percutaneous nephrostogram was performed which demonstrated
     continued obstruction. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 767**] guide wire and subsequently a 10 French
     nephrostomy tube was placed over the wire with a pigtail formed within the

     [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Signed and informed consent was obtained from the patient's
     daughter.  A pre-procedure timeout was performed to verify the patient's
     identifying information.  The patient was placed prone on the angiography
     table and the pre-existing nephrostomy tube and nephrostomy catheter site were
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
     
     1% lidocaine as well as lidocaine jelly were used for local anesthesia.  A
     0.018 Glidewire was used to advance through the pre-existing tract along the
     right flank.  A 4 French dilator was then placed over the wire.  Contrast was
     hand injected through this dilator which demonstrated the tip in the renal
     pelvis and a percutaneous nephrostogram was performed which demonstrated
     continued obstruction. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 767**] guide wire and subsequently a 10 French
     nephrostomy tube was placed over the wire with a pigtail formed within the
     right renal pelvis. The catheter was then connected to bag drainage and
     sutured in place.
     
     A tube nephrostogram was performed through the pre-existing catheter within
     the left flank which showed non- opacification of the distal ureter.  A 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was advanced through the catheter and the old catheter was
     removed. A new, 10 French nephrostomy tube was then placed over the wire with
     the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis. Contrast injected through the catheter
     demonstrated appropriate position. The catheter was connected to an external
     drainage bag and secured to the skin with sutures and a StatLock.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Successful placement of a 10 French nephrostomy tube through the pre-
     existing right flank tract with the pigtail coiled within the right renal

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Urinary obstructions secondary to XRT from cervical cancer.  The
     right percutaneous nephrostomy tube had fallen out at the nursing home.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4964**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 4**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Signed and informed consent was obtained from the patient's
     daughter.  A pre-procedure timeout was performed to verify the patient's
     identifying information.  The patient was placed prone on the angiography
     table and the pre-existing nephrostomy tube and nephrostomy catheter site were
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
     
     1% lidocaine as well as lidocaine jelly were used for local anesthesia.  A
     0.018 Glidewire was used to advance through the pre-existing tract along the
     right flank.  A 4 French dilator was then placed over the wire.  Contrast was
     hand injected through this dilator which demonstrated the tip in the renal
     pelvis and a percutaneous nephrostogram was performed which demonstrated
     continued obstruction. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 767**] guide wire and subsequently a 10 French
     nephrostomy tube was placed over the wire with a pigtail formed within the
     right renal pelvis. The catheter was then connected to bag drainage and
     sutured in place.
     
     A tube nephrostogram was performed through the pre-existing catheter within
     the left flank which showed non- opacification of the distal ureter.  A 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was advanced through the catheter and the old catheter was
     removed. A new, 10 French nephrostomy tube was then placed over the wire with
     the pigtail formed in the renal pelvis. Contrast injected through the catheter
     demonstrated appropriate position. The catheter was connected to an external
     drainage bag and secured to the skin with sutures and a StatLock.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Successful placement of a 10 French nephrostomy tube through the pre-
     existing right flank tract with the pigtail coiled within the right renal

     pelvis, with multiple surgical sutures along the pelvic sidewalls. Surrounding
     subcutaneous tissues contain diffuse soft tissue stranding consistent with
     third spacing.
     
     The patient is status post right hip replacement.  There is a soft tissue
     defect extending to the lower sacrum/coccyx with surrounding soft tissue
     density with no evidence of lytic changes or sclerotic changes to suggest
     osteomyelitis.
     
     CTA CHEST:  There is no evidence of filling defects within the pulmonary
     arterial vasculature.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  The aorta is of
     normal caliber throughout its visualized thoracic course with no evidence of
     dissection.  There are coronary artery and aortic calcifications present.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  81-year-old female with multiple urinary tract infections,
     requires IV access for antibiotics and blood draws.  Patient has preexistent
     4-French single lumen PICC line, which needs to be exchanged for a 5-French
     dual lumen catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 633**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 489**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**], the Attending
     Radiologist, being present and supervising.
     
     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the site of the procedure, and appropriate
     requisition.  Once the above were verified, the patient was positioned in
     supine fashion on a special procedure/angiography table.  The right arm was
     then abducted and externally rotated.  The right arm was prepped and draped
     from the axilla to the antecubital fossa along with the exterior segment of
     the 4-French single lumen PICC line in place.
     
     The PICC line was accessed with a guidewire.  A guidewire was advanced to the
     axillary vein segment using flouroscopic guidance.  Subsequently, the
     guidewire was left in situ as the PICC line was removed over the guidewire.
     Subsequently, a peel- away sheath/introducer was delivered over the guidewire.
     Guidewire was employed to measure the intravascular length of the PICC line to
     be placed. The 5-French dual lumen PICC line was tailored at the 32 cm mark
     and delivered using modified Seldinger technique to the level of the caudal
     superior vena cava. Once final position was confirmed to be optimal, the
     catheter was StatLocked in place.  Both lumens of the catheter were flushed
     and heparin locked per protocol.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  No
     complications were encountered.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  1% Xylocaine, 2 cc local infiltration.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post successful exchange of 4-French single lumen PICC
     line for a 5-French dual lumen PICC line.  Final catheter length is 32 cm. Tip
     position is caudal superior vena cava.  Access point is right basilic vein.

     the 4-French single lumen PICC line in place.
     
     The PICC line was accessed with a guidewire.  A guidewire was advanced to the
     axillary vein segment using flouroscopic guidance.  Subsequently, the
     guidewire was left in situ as the PICC line was removed over the guidewire.
     Subsequently, a peel- away sheath/introducer was delivered over the guidewire.
     Guidewire was employed to measure the intravascular length of the PICC line to
     be placed. The 5-French dual lumen PICC line was tailored at the 32 cm mark
     and delivered using modified Seldinger technique to the level of the caudal
     superior vena cava. Once final position was confirmed to be optimal, the
     catheter was StatLocked in place.  Both lumens of the catheter were flushed
     and heparin locked per protocol.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  No
     complications were encountered.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.

     INDICATION FOR EXAM:  Patient with systemic candidiasis that needs another IV
     access.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs.  [**Last Name (STitle) 959**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4**], the
     attending radiologist, who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient's left arm was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  Since no suitable veins were visible, ultrasound
     was used to identify the left cephalic vein, which was patent and
     compressible.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, a
     21-gauge needle was used to access the left cephalic vein.  A 0.018 guide wire
     was then advanced through the needle into the vein.  The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French micropuncture sheath.  The guide wire was advanced into the SVC
     and based on the markers on the wire, PICC line was trimmed to a length of 41
     cm.  The PICC was then advanced over the wire into the left brachiocephalic
     vein under fluoroscopic guidance, due to mild response of the vein.  The wire
     and the peel-away sheath were removed.  The catheter was flushed, capped, and
     heplocked.  Finally, the catheter was statlocked into place and a sterile
     transparent dressing was applied.  Final fluoroscopic image was taken
     demonstrating the tip of the catheter to be in the left brachiocephalic vein.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 5 French double lumen 41-cm long within
     the left cephalic vein with the tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.  The
     line is ready for use.

     CHEST, AP FILM.
     
     HISTORY:  Coughing, rales, and wheezing.
     
     Picc Line is in mid SVC.  There are low lung volumes, making evaluation of
     heart size difficult in this portable AP film.  There is persistent opacity at
     the left base obscuring the left hemidiaphragm consistent with
     atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe, possibly with an associated
     small left pleural effusion.  The left basilar opacity is increased since the
     prior study of [**3436-6-23**].  The remainder of the lungs are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at left base consistent with increased
     atelectasis/consolidation.  Cannot rule out small left pleural effusion.
     Lateral film may be helpful to better evaluate.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION FOR EXAM:  Patient with systemic candidiasis that needs another IV
     access.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs.  [**Last Name (STitle) 959**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4**], the
     attending radiologist, who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient's left arm was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  Since no suitable veins were visible, ultrasound
     was used to identify the left cephalic vein, which was patent and
     compressible.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, a
     21-gauge needle was used to access the left cephalic vein.  A 0.018 guide wire
     was then advanced through the needle into the vein.  The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French micropuncture sheath.  The guide wire was advanced into the SVC
     and based on the markers on the wire, PICC line was trimmed to a length of 41
     cm.  The PICC was then advanced over the wire into the left brachiocephalic
     vein under fluoroscopic guidance, due to mild response of the vein.  The wire
     and the peel-away sheath were removed.  The catheter was flushed, capped, and
     heplocked.  Finally, the catheter was statlocked into place and a sterile
     transparent dressing was applied.  Final fluoroscopic image was taken
     demonstrating the tip of the catheter to be in the left brachiocephalic vein.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 5 French double lumen 41-cm long within
     the left cephalic vein with the tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.  The
     line is ready for use.

     PERCUTANEOUS GASTROSTOMY TUBE CHANGE
     
     INDICATION:  Current long-term indwelling percutaneous feeding tube is clogged
     and needs replacement.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient's family requested replacement of the
     current percutaneous tube with a low profile detachable feeding tube
     apparatus.
     
     Injection of contrast through the indwelling percutaneous feeding tube
     opacified the stomach with the tube entering at roughly the proximal-to-mid
     body of the stomach along the greater curvature.  This demonstrated that the
     tube was indeed a gastrostomy tube and not a jejunostomy feeding tube.
     
     A guide wire was then passed through the old G-tube into the stomach and the
     G-tube was withdrawn over the wire.  However, its internal retention cup/disk
     was not able to be pulled out of the percutaneous tract and therefore it was
     cut and released.  If this is fixed to the stomach, it should not interfere
     with feedings or gastric function.  If it becomes free, it is expected that it
     will most likely pass through the GI tract without difficulty.
     
     A MIC-KEY 16 French x 4 cm low profile percutaneous gastrostomy tube was then
     inserted through the old tract over a guide wire into the stomach.  Its 5 cc
     retention balloon was inflated with 5 cc of saline.  The balloon appeared to
     secure the catheter in place well.
     
     Subsequent injection of contrast through the new MIC-KEY G-tube revealed
     unremarkable position of the retention balloon within the gastric lumen and
     easy flow of contrast through the low profile tube into the stomach.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well with application of topical lidocaine
     jelly.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Replacement of old clogged percutaneous gastrostomy tube with a
     16 French 4 cm low profile MIC-KEY G-tube, as above.

     HISTORY:  New-onset hypotension.  Evaluate possible aortic dissection or
     pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-18**] through [**7-6**]:
     
     Moderate cardiac enlargement is worsening and mild edema is new.  Moderate
     left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse are unchanged.  Tip of the

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with blocked Jejunostomy tube (NOT G tube)                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please replace J-tube as current tube clogged                                   
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PERCUTANEOUS GASTROSTOMY TUBE CHANGE
     
     INDICATION:  Current long-term indwelling percutaneous feeding tube is clogged
     and needs replacement.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient's family requested replacement of the
     current percutaneous tube with a low profile detachable feeding tube
     apparatus.
     
     Injection of contrast through the indwelling percutaneous feeding tube
     opacified the stomach with the tube entering at roughly the proximal-to-mid
     body of the stomach along the greater curvature.  This demonstrated that the
     tube was indeed a gastrostomy tube and not a jejunostomy feeding tube.
     
     A guide wire was then passed through the old G-tube into the stomach and the
     G-tube was withdrawn over the wire.  However, its internal retention cup/disk
     was not able to be pulled out of the percutaneous tract and therefore it was
     cut and released.  If this is fixed to the stomach, it should not interfere
     with feedings or gastric function.  If it becomes free, it is expected that it
     will most likely pass through the GI tract without difficulty.
     
     A MIC-KEY 16 French x 4 cm low profile percutaneous gastrostomy tube was then
     inserted through the old tract over a guide wire into the stomach.  Its 5 cc
     retention balloon was inflated with 5 cc of saline.  The balloon appeared to
     secure the catheter in place well.
     
     Subsequent injection of contrast through the new MIC-KEY G-tube revealed
     unremarkable position of the retention balloon within the gastric lumen and
     easy flow of contrast through the low profile tube into the stomach.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well with application of topical lidocaine
     jelly.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Replacement of old clogged percutaneous gastrostomy tube with a
     16 French 4 cm low profile MIC-KEY G-tube, as above.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  81-year-old female with multiple medical problems and intrapelvic
     fistulas now with hypotension and abdominal distention.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3436-6-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without
     IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images were also performed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
     left greater than right with associated atelectasis.  There is a small
     pericardial effusion.  Given the limitations of evaluation without IV
     contrast, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     There is a small amount of perihepatic fluid.  A hyperdensity within the
     pancreatic duct, likely represents refluxed contrast.  Bilateral percutaneous
     nephrostomy tubes are again seen.
     
     A catheter is seen within the stomach.  There is massive gastric dilatation as
     well as massive dilation of the loops of small bowel.  There are
     scattered air fluid levels.  Contrast reaches the level of the proximal small
     bowel. Marked wall thickening is seen at this level and vascular compromise
     cannot be excluded. A G-tube plug is seen in the terminal ileum.  The loops of
     small bowel distal to this plug are collapsed. This likely represents the site
     of obstruction.  A small amount of fluid is seen surrounding the small bowel
     loops at this location.
     
     Contrast within the ascending colon likely represents retained contrast from
     the previous examination.  
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a moderate amount of fluid within the
     pelvis.  Stool is likely seen within the bladder consistent with the patient's
     known rectovaginal fistula.
     
     A fixation pin is seen within the proximal femur.  A soft tissue defect in the
     lower outer sacrum/coccyx is seen with no evidence of cortical destruction to
     suggest osteomyelitis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Again demonstrate bilateral sacroiliac sclerotic changes.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images confirmed the above findings.

     Comparison is made to an upright radiograph of the chest dated [**3436-7-11**].
     
     SUPINE PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  A left-sided PICC line is seen with
     the tip in the left brachiocephalic vein. Differences in opacity of the lungs
     are most likely due to layering of the previously seen pleural effusions on
     this supine radiograph. Hazy opacity in the right upper lung is likely
     atelectasis. The heart size is stable.  Again noted are bilateral

     Note is made of air-filled stomach and several air-filled bowel loops in mid
     abdomen.
