Addendum:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5103**] was kept one additional day for a follow up CT head 
and EEG per neurology request for change in MS over a the period 
of one weeks time. His head CT showed resolving areas of 
hemorrhage without any evidence of rebleed. An EEG was obtained 
on the day of discharge. The results will be faxed to the rehab 
facility once they are in. The patient remained afebrile and 
without leukocytosis for >5 days prior to discharge. Blood 
cultures have all been negative. The patient will be discharged 
to a rehab facility today after his EEG. He has an appointment 
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in neurology after discharge. Per neurology 
the patient's SBP should be kept between 130-160 and his 
platelets kept above 100k.

Head CT: 1. Evolution of blood products in the area of the right 
caudate head. No new areas of hemorrhage.
2. Interval partial opacification of the mastoid air cells.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient with intraventricular hemorrhage post-fall.  Patient was
     found in apartment after unknown period of time, possibly days.  Pressure
     sores found on knees.  Evaluate for interval change.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.  No outside hospital examinations
     have been provided.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  There is a sizeable hemorrhage centered about the
     right caudate nucleus, measuring up to 4.1 cm in diameter.  The hemorrhage
     extends into the ventricular system, with hemorrhage expanding the frontal
     [**Doctor Last Name 79**] of the right lateral ventricle, displacing the septum pellucidum 11 mm
     leftward. Hemorrhage layers posteriorly within the lateral ventricles. There
     is a moderate amount of edema surrounding the area of parenchymal hemorrhage.
     Aside from displacement of the septum pellucidum leftward, other structures do
     not appear to be displaced.  There is moderate mucosal thickening within the
     ethmoid air cells, and probable mucus retention cysts within both maxillary
     antra.  The left mastoid air cells are less pneumatized than the right.
     Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     Intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right caudate nucleus head,
     possibly hypertensive in etiology. Hemorrhage extends into both lateral
     ventricles. The septum pellucidum is displaced 11 mm leftward.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1415**] on the afternoon of [**3342-3-12**].

     placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  AP upright portable chest x-ray dated [**3342-3-11**].
     
     AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  A Dobbhoff tube has been placed with the tip
     in the left piriform sinus and the tube coiled within the mid/distal
     esophagus.  Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiac silhouette is
     unchanged.  There is new  right hilar fullness with suggestion of underlying
     lymphadenopathy.  Opacification of the right heart border suggests right
     middle lobe collapse.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There are no effusions.
     The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures again demonstrate
     degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Dobbhoff tube coiled within the mid esophagus with the tip overlying the
     left larynx.
     2.  Obscuration of the right heart border consistent with right middle lobe
     collapse and consolidation.  Further evaluation with a lateral film is
     recommended.

Resp: Lungs are coarse in all fields, diminished bibasilar --> at 4am noted increased work of breathing and audible wheezes, non-responsive to albuterol/atrovent nebs. Chest xray pending. SPO2 remains in high 90's and rate is high teens to low twenties, however appears labored and remains wheezy in all fields. Prior to that had been on room air. Placed on humidified face mask at 40% mainly for humidity as pt's secretions and mouth are very dry.

CV: Sinus rhythm with frequent supraventricular ectopy. Remains hypertensive with SBP 160-180's+, non-responsive to hydralazine and lopressor. Initiated labetalol gtt as SBP was occasionally in the 190's, however questionably it is contributing to reactive airway/bronchospasm so gtt is stopped and plan to be discussed in morning rounds. Goal MAP per neurology is less than 135, we remain in this parameter. Strong palpable distal pulses. PIVx1 placed tonight.

GI: Abdomen soft, non-tender, very slightly distended - ? last BM. Pt d/c'd his own NGT and RN/MD were unable to replace, will remain NPO pending speech & swallow eval.

     FINDINGS:  A moderately large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within the
     right caudate head measures slightly smaller than on prior exam at 3.8 cm in
     diameter.  The hemorrhage extends into the ventricular system, and there is
     stable or slightly decreased right-to-left shift at the level of the septum
     pellucidum by 9 mm.  Periventricular edema within the right frontal lobe is
     either stable or minimally increased since the prior exam.  There is no
     additional evidence of herniation.  Layering blood within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 79**]
     of the left lateral ventricle is slightly decreased, and that within the right
     lateral ventricle is slightly increased.
     
     Dense mucosal thickening and polyps within bilateral maxillary sinuses are
     again noted.  There is near complete opacification of bilateral ethmoid air
     cells, dense mucosal thickening is also seen in bilateral sphenoid air cells
     and frontal sinuses.  No new air-fluid levels are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight interval decrease in size of right intraparenchymal
     hemorrhage, with slight decrease in right-to-left midline shift at the level
     of the septum pellucidum.  No new herniation.

     Since most recent prior film, there appears to be a slight increase to
     retrocardiac opacity and mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting
     underlying left lower lobe atelectasis, however, consolidative process cannot
     be completely excluded.  Remaining lung fields appear grossly clear, without

     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**3342-3-21**]
     
     INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage.  Respiratory distress and fever.
     
     COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph of [**3342-3-20**].
     
     Multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral
     contrast administration.  Images are presented for display in the axial plane
     at 5 mm and 1.25 mm collimation.  A series of coronal reconstruction images
     are also presented for review.
     
     The examination is of suboptimal quality due to extensive respiratory motion
     and  inadvertent imaging during the expiratory phase of respiration rather
     than the standard and inspiratory technique.  This limits assessment for
     subtle areas of abnormality such as small lung nodules.
     
     Small left and trace right pleural effusions are present with adjacent
     dependent areas of atelectasis.  No confluent areas of consolidation are
     present.  Assessment of the airways demonstrates accentuated expiratory
     collapse within the main bronchi, bronchus intermedius and lower lobe bronchi
     as well as portions of the trachea concerning for airway malacia.
     
     The intrathoracic esophagus is markedly distended to approximately the level
     of the carina.  Below this level, there is mild intermittent distention.  A
     small hiatal hernia is present.  Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm
     to terminate in the upper stomach.
     
     Asymmetry of the vocal cords is present with the left appearing medially
     displaced compared to the right and the left appearing more full and globular
     than the right side.  Within the mediastinum, there are several anterior
     mediastinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter.  These do not
     individually meet size criteria for enlargement but are increased in number. 
     The main pulmonary artery is enlarged at 4.2 cm.  Heart is mildly enlarged and
     diffuse coronary artery calcifications are present.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, a cystic lesion is present in the
     upper pole portion of the right kidney measuring over 4 cm in diameter.  This
     is probably a simple cyst, but is difficult to fully characterize in this
     unenhanced scan with a moderate degree of image, noise and degradation from
     motion.  Remaining imaged portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable on this
     unenhanced CT which is not specifically tailored to evaluate the abdominal
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, aspiration risk.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient's son. 
     The anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. 
     Insufflation of the stomach via a previously placed NG tube was performed. 
     This allowed direct fluoroscopic visualization of a distended gastric body. 
     The colon was also air filled, which gave additional benefit in that this
     could be easily avoided with tube placement.
     
     1% lidocaine without epinephrine was used to anesthetize the anterior
     abdominal wall after which two T-fasteners were placed along the greater
     curvature of the stomach.  Between these two T-fasteners, a 5-French sheath
     was placed and through which a Kumpe catheter and Bentson guidewire were used
     to manipulate the catheter into the proximal jejunum.  The [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was
     exchanged for an Amplatz wire.  The tract was then dilated after which a
     14-French GJ tube was placed, tip within the proximal jejunum and confirmed
     with contrast injection.  The catheter was secured in place with a
     flexi-tract.
     
     Of note, ultrasound was performed within the Angiography Suite which again
     demonstrated distal right superficial femoral vein wall thickening only, no
     evidence of acute DVT.  After discussion with the referring physicians, given
     the lack of acute clot burden, IVC filter placement was not carried out.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Placement of a 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 1059**] GJ tube cuff, tip within the
     proximal jejunum and ready for use.

     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  There is interim evolution of blood products
     within the previously described intraparenchymal hemorrhage, centered at the
     right caudate head.  On the current study, the largest area of acute
     hemorrhage measures 2.2 x 1.5 cm on axial images.  There is continued right to
     left shift of the septum pellucidum.  Hypodensity of the right frontal and
     subinsular region parenchyma is similar in peripheral extent, representing
     vasogenic edema.  Adjacent to the area of hemorrhage, hypodensity may
     represent encephalomalacic change.  There are no new areas of hemorrhage.
     Blood within the lateral ventricles is nearly resolved, with a small amount
     seen layering posteriorly on the right.  There is partial opacification of the
     posterior ethmoid air cells, and circumferential mucosal thickening within the
     sphenoid sinus.  There are mucus retention cysts in the maxillary antra,
     bilaterally. The mastoid air cells are nearly completely opacified, increased
