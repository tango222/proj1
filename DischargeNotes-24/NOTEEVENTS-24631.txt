CXR: Cardiac enlargement with mild congestive heart failure.
CTA: 1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar 
atelectasis. A consolidation in the left lower lobe cannot be 
excluded.
3. Small pulmonary nodules seen on the prior study are not 
visualized on the current study.
CT Head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. No evidence of 
infarction. Mild left maxillary sinus disease
ECG: 60 bpm, L axis, sinus, no st-tw changes

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Plan:
1. respiratory failure--initial thinking was pneumonia vs chf vs 
central cause. unclear if pt is chronic C02 retainer; no hx 
COPD. ABGs with pH 7.26 then 7.24 then 7.28 on bipap. No longer 
on BiPAP.  CXR with LLL effusion vs consolidation vs 
atelectasis, not significantly changed from old films (has had 
pleural effusions consistently since [**3285**]). retrocardiac 
density. R base with small effusion. CT without evidence of PE.  
Pt was put on clinda temporarily.  By the time pt was 
transferred to floor, respiratory status had stabilized and pt 
required about 1-2L O2 by NC with good O2 sats.

2. hypernatremia--Na on presentation 154. Given NS to rehydrate, 
as initially thought to have hypovolemic hypernatremia given 
limited diet, NH residence, limited ability feed himself, on 
lasix 40mg daily at baseline. On prior admissions has had sodium 
of 145 but not as high as 154.  Free water flushes were given 
through the NG tube, and his sodium came down to 148, then 141.  


3. mental status change--seen by neuro in the EW. Unclear if L 
sided weakness is worse as can't cooperate w/full neuro exam. 
Head CT neg; no anticoagulation per neuro recs. Would have 
needed intubation to obtain MRI; not done per neuro.  Systolic 
BP was kept around 150 initially with concern of stroke.  Mental 
status continued to improve on transfer to the floor, and pt was 
somewhat responsive and somewhat able to follow commands.  Pt's 
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], notes that this is still far from his 
baseline, when he was able to communicate somewhat.

4. CHF--systolic and diastolic. CXR without evidence significant 
failure. Stable for now.  Pt was diuresed with lasix; lungs 
remained clear with no increase in O2 requirement.  Weights were 
measured but difficult to interpret as different numbers of bed 
clothes/sheets/pillows were on the bed each morning.    

5. DM--takes glyburide at baseline. Covered with insulin scale, 
qid checks and dosing of humalog (correction doses). QID 
fingersticks were continued, which showed good glucose control.  
On addition of NG tube feeds, NPH insulin was given at 4 units 
bid, which resulted in good control of glucose, around 90s-130s. 
 

6. bradycardia--pt bradys down to 30s-40s.  Likely has some AV 
nodal dysfunction.  However, is asymptomatic and maintains his 
BP adequately.  Telemetry was discontinued after discussion with 
cardiology, as pt is not a candidate for a pacer.  Remained 
asymptomatic with bradycardia, and actually was noted to have a 
more normal pulse in the last few days prior to discharge.

7. HTN--BP kept slightly high initially given concern for CVA. 
Was put back on lisinopril and titrated up; giving 40mg daily on 
discharge.

8.  Nutrition - initially an NG tube was placed, and pt received 
tube feeds with nutrition on consult for particular 
recommendations.  Pt continued to pull out NG tube, and soft 
restraints were placed to prevent this.  As pt's mental status 
did not seem to improve substantially, and a speech/swallow 
evaluation revealed that pt was aspirating anything placed in 
his mouth, the family was contacted and met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], 
pt's PCP to discuss options for long-term nutrition.  Pt's 
family corroborated that they had discussed this with him in the 
past and he would want a G tube.  Therefore, a PEG was placed by 
GI, which pt tolerated well.  Tube feeds were restarted, and pt 
was discharged back to nursing home 24 hours after tube feeds 
through G tube were begun.

9. prophylaxis--sq heparin, IV protonix

10. code--full. Daughter corroborated this on several occasions.
