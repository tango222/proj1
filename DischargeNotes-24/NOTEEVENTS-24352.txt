Admission Date:  [**3238-5-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**3238-5-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**3152-6-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:  C-MED

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 85 year-old woman,
a resident of [**Hospital3 1742**] with the history of
coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.  She
has no prior history of intervention into her coronary
arteries, who developed and acute onset of chest pain and
shortness of breath around 11 P.M. the night of admission.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 182**] where she received aspirin and sublingual
nitroglycerin en route.  In the emergency department her
electrocardiogram revealed deep around [**Street Address 975**] depressions
laterally and in the precordial leads the chest x-ray was
consistent with some pulmonary edema.  The patient received
Lasix 40 mg intravenous times one and Captopril 25 mg times
one.  Patient also received another sublingual nitroglycerin
after which her blood pressure dropped to around 60 systolic
for several minutes.  The patient remained with her baseline
mental status throughout.  She was given approximately 500 cc
of normal saline after diuresing for her hypotension.  Her
blood pressure increased to around 100 systolic.  Patient
described onset of her substernal chest pain with radiation
to the left arm, shortness of breath, no nausea, vomiting or
diuresis.  At baseline she has positive three pillow
orthopnea and positive lower extremity edema.  However,
possibly both of these have been worsening over the past few
days.  The patient was still complaining of mild chest pain
in the emergency department and she finally received 0.5 mg
of intravenous morphine to which she responded well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status
post myocardial infarction in [**3236-8-19**].  2) Congestive
heart failure.  Patient has history of ejection fraction of
20 percent on echocardiogram in 8/2000.  She has severe
global right ventricular hypokinesis.  She also has severe
left ventricular dysfunction.  On a Persantine median in
[**8-/3236**] she had reversible inferior defect in the apex which
was again not intervened upon at that time.  3) Patient has a
history of hypothyroidism.  4) Chronic urinary tract
infections.  5) Osteoporosis.  6) Choledocholithiasis, status
post papillotomy.  7) Status post appendectomy.  8)
Tuberculosis.  9) Colonic pseudo obstruction.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 80 mg p.o. q. day,
Levoxil 25 mg p.o. q. day, potassium chloride 20 mg p.o. q
day and multivitamin 1 p.o. q. day, Axid 150 mg p.o. q. day,
calcium carbonate 650 mg p.o. t.i.d., Serax 10 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. q.h.s., Remeron 30 mg p.o. q.h.s.,
Plavix 75 mg q day and Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a [**Hospital3 1742**] resident.
She has been Do Not Resuscitate, Do Not Intubate for some
time now and her health care proxy is her son who lives in
[**Country **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission her blood
pressure was 156/52, pulse of 82, respirations 30, saturation
96 percent on 3 liters.  She is afebrile.  Generally she is
pleasant, alert and oriented and in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:  normocephalic,
atraumatic, extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx moist.
Neck:  she had jugular venous pressure around 10 cm.  Lungs:
she had a few crackles anteriorly.  Cardiac examination:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 with II/VI systolic
ejection border at the left sternal border.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, distended, obese with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  she had about 3+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Her extremities were warm, however, pulses could not be
palpated.

LABORATORY DATA:  At time of admission her white count 5.9,
hematocrit 37.0, platelets 207.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.1,
chloride 100, bicarb 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.8, glucose 205.
Her cardiacs were normal.  Her initial CK was 85.
Electrocardiogram with [**Street Address 975**] depressions in lateral and
precordial leads.

HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the CMED
service for possible coronary ischemia.  She had her cardiac
enzymes cycled.  Her second CK came back at 412 with an MB of
16.  At that point patient was started on heparin drip.  She
was continued on her aspirin and Plavix and beta blocker.
The patient had a history of medical management in the past.
However, this issue was readdressed with the health care
proxy, her son in [**Name2 (NI) **] who at this point decided that
cardiac catheterization is preferable from his standpoint.
She was catheterized on [**5-18**].  At that time it was noted
that she had an occluded LAD which 99.9 percent occluded with
faint collaterals filling from the distal LAD which was
stented.  She also had 95 percent large left circumflex to OM
lesion which was also stented and her RCA was totally
occluded which was not intervened upon.  The patient
initially did well after catheterization and returned to he
floor with stable vital signs.  However, later in the evening
she developed increasing abdominal pain, hypotension with
systolic blood pressure decreasing to the 70s.  The patient
was also noted to have tachypnea and hematocrit acutely
dropped.  On examination she was found to have a large firm
area on her lower abdomen.  She was sent to stat abdominal CT
which showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.  However,
it did show an intra-abdominal hematoma tracking from her
right groin at the site of the catheterization as well as a
small hematoma in the right groin.  She was transfused and
the patient remained stable overnight after that with her
blood pressure increasing appropriately.  The following day
the patient's hematocrit remained stable and the patient
continued to have abdominal pain for which she received
intermittent intravenous morphine with good relief.  Her
lipids were checked and she was noted to have an LDL of 171,
HDL of 51 and total cholesterol of 254 at which time she was
started on Lipitor.  Her beta blocker had been stopped on the
night of her episode of hypotension when her hematoma was
observed.  It was restarted again on [**3238-5-19**] when the patient
did well.  She also had an ultrasound of her right femoral
artery which showed evidence of a small pseudoaneurysm
measuring .92 x .92 cm with no evidence of arteriovenous
fistula.  Surgery and vascular surgery were consulted who
felt that at this time there was no need for thrombin
injection and that the pseudoaneurysm would most likely
resolve on its own.  The following morning on [**5-20**] the
patient had an episode of bradycardia and hypotension at
around noon with her heart rate decreasing to the 30s and her
systolic blood pressure remaining in the 60s to 70s despite
intravenous fluid for approximately an hour.  The patient was
also transfused for a unit of blood.  Vascular surgery was
called.  We had a stat bedside ultrasound which showed that
the pseudoaneurysm was actually resolving.  She was sent down
again for repeat stat abdominal CT scan which showed that the
intra-abdominal hematoma was actually smaller in side and the
pseudoaneurysm had likely thrombosed and the patient was
transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for observation.  The
patient did not require any pressors while in the Cardiac
Care Unit and her pressure and hematocrit remained stable
overnight.  She was then transferred back to the floor where
she remained stable.  Her Lopressor continued to be followed.
Of note, also while the patient was in the Cardiac Care Unit
there was an episode where she had a headache and some
difficulty speaking and some left arm weakness.  They got a
stat head CT which was negative for events of bleed or acute
stroke.  Her symptoms resolved within a few hours and
neurology was consulted.  Neurology noted that she had no arm
weakness or difficulty speaking at the time of their
examination and it was felt that most likely event was
consistent with transient ischemic attack in the setting of
hypoperfusion.  The patient was sent down for repeat head CT
several days later which showed again no evidence of acute
change and some evidence of old chronic infarct.  Otherwise
the patient had a repeat chest x-ray on [**5-22**] which showed a
question of a right upper lobe opacity which had also been
seen on a portable chest x-ray on [**5-21**] which is concerning
for pneumonia so in spite of the fact that the patient
remained afebrile with stable white count it was felt that
the risks of not treating her pneumonia would be greater than
treating so the patient was started on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  The patient was also diuresed gently once she
returned back to the floor and the plan is to return to
[**Hospital3 1742**] facility on Monday, [**3238-5-24**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  CAD, CHF, ejection fraction of 20% and now with chest pain.  Assess
     for aortic dissection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the aortic bifurcation without and with IV contrast,
     according to the CTA protocol.  Nonionic contrast was administered secondary
     to rapid rate of bolus injection required for this study.  Multiplanar
     reformatted images were also obtained.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen/pelvis of [**3235-5-23**].
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The intrathoracic aorta is markedly
     ectatic, without evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.  There is
     diffuse calcification of the visualized aorta.  Soft tissue windows also show
     a few nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes of the mediastinum.  There are no
     pathologically enlarged hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  The heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  Lung windows demonstrate dependent atelectasis.
      There is a tiny right lower lobe nodule, unchanged from the previous exam.
     No focal consolidations or pleural effusions.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen is a significant amount
     of air within the biliary system, slightly increased from the exam of 1999.
     The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, left adrenal gland and unopacified loops of
     large/small bowel are stable.  Again seen is an approximately 2.3 cm right
     adrenal mass, with attenuation values consistent with an adenoma.  Again seen
     are a few punctate calcifications of the liver parenchyma, suggestive of
     previous granulomatous disease.  The intra-abdominal aorta is again calcified,
     ectatic and markedly tortuous.  No evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysmal
     dilatation.  Noted is a significant amount of mural thrombus immediately
     proximal to the oartic bifurcation.
     
     Limited views of the upper pelvis demonstrate no gross abnormalities.  Please
     note that this is an incomplete evaluation of the pelvis.  Noted are multiple
     injection granulomas of the subcutaneous tissues of the gluteal region.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no interval change in the appearance of the osseous
     structures.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the above findings.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  CAD, CHF, ejection fraction of 20% and now with chest pain.  Assess
     for aortic dissection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the aortic bifurcation without and with IV contrast,
     according to the CTA protocol.  Nonionic contrast was administered secondary
     to rapid rate of bolus injection required for this study.  Multiplanar
     reformatted images were also obtained.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen/pelvis of [**3235-5-23**].
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The intrathoracic aorta is markedly
     ectatic, without evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.  There is
     diffuse calcification of the visualized aorta.  Soft tissue windows also show
     a few nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes of the mediastinum.  There are no
     pathologically enlarged hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  The heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  Lung windows demonstrate dependent atelectasis.
      There is a tiny right lower lobe nodule, unchanged from the previous exam.
     No focal consolidations or pleural effusions.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen is a significant amount
     of air within the biliary system, slightly increased from the exam of 1999.
     The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, left adrenal gland and unopacified loops of
     large/small bowel are stable.  Again seen is an approximately 2.3 cm right
     adrenal mass, with attenuation values consistent with an adenoma.  Again seen
     are a few punctate calcifications of the liver parenchyma, suggestive of
     previous granulomatous disease.  The intra-abdominal aorta is again calcified,
     ectatic and markedly tortuous.  No evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysmal
     dilatation.  Noted is a significant amount of mural thrombus immediately
     proximal to the oartic bifurcation.
     
     Limited views of the upper pelvis demonstrate no gross abnormalities.  Please
     note that this is an incomplete evaluation of the pelvis.  Noted are multiple
     injection granulomas of the subcutaneous tissues of the gluteal region.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no interval change in the appearance of the osseous
     structures.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the above findings.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Shortness of breath with rales in all fields, chest pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3237-6-9**].
     
     AP CHEST:  The heart is unchanged.  The aortic arch appears more prominent
     than on the prior exam and there is more soft tissue adjacent to the wall
     calcifications than previously.  There is no left apical capping.  The
     pulmonary vascularity appears prominent however not significantly changed
     compared to the prior exam.  There are diffuse bilateral pulmonary
     interstitial infiltrates.  However on reviewing several other exams these have
     been present although slightly worsened on today's exam.  There is also
     persistent density behind the left heart, not significantly changed.  Osseous
     structures reveal diffuse osteopenia and degenerative changes.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Mild cardiac failure.
     2.  Indistinct appearance to the aortic knob with increased soft tissue
     density laterally.  While this may be related to the patient's rotation,
     aortic dissection is a consideration in the appropriate clinical setting.
     Recommend either repeat chest X-ray with improved positioning or chest CT
     based on clinical suspicion.

     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases through
     pubic symphysis without contrast.
     
     COMPARISON: CT from the previous day.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural effusions as well
     as dependent atelectasis.  There is cardiomegaly.  The abdominal aorta is
     ectatic and contains coarse calcification.  There is stable pneumobilia
     related to patient's prior surgery.  The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, left
     adrenal gland and unopacified loops of large and small bowel are stable. Again
     seen is a right adrenal mass consistent with an adenoma.  There are a few
     punctate calcifications within the liver suggestive of previous granulomatous
     disease.  There is no intraabdominal free fluid or free air. There is no
     significant adenopathy.
     
     CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST: There is a large hematoma anterior and lateral to the
     bladder in the space of Retzius.  A small amount of hematoma is seen tracking
     up the right paracolic gutter.  This is more dense in the right groin compared
     to the left making the right groin puncture site the likely source.  The
     hematoma is compressing the bladder.  A foley catheter is seen within the
     bladder.  The uterus, adnexa and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is no
     intraperitoneal bleed.  There is no retroperitoneal bleed.  There is high
     attenuation foci within both buttocks related to prior injections.  The
     patient has had a right hip replacement.  There are severe degenerative
     changes throughout the spine.

     INDICATION: Increased productive cough and sputum.
     
     Comparison: [**3238-5-20**].
     
     AP CHEST:  In the interval since the prior study, there is an area of
     opacification in the right upper lobe, peripherally.  The right scapula
     appears to partially overlie this region, which makes characterization
     somewhat difficult.  Otherwise, there is little interval change in the
     appearance of the chest with bilateral retrocardiac opacifications suggesting
     atelectasis, ectatic aorta.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New opacification in peripheral right upper lobe which is
     difficult to evaluate, secondary to overlying scapula.  This may represent a
     loculated pleural effusion, vs a peripheral area of consolidation.  A repeat
     study is recommended with repositioning of the scapula for further
     assessment.

     HISTORY:  Status post cardiac stent four days ago, now with slurred speech and
     left sided weakness.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the head without the
     administration of IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT head [**3238-5-20**].
     
     CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of intra or extra axial
     hemorrhages.  There is no mass effect or shift of midline structures.  Again
     noted are regions of low attenuation within the left occipital lobe and right
     frontal lobe without surrounding edema or effacement of the sulci. This
     appearance is unchanged from the previous exam.  There is also calcification
     within the left basal ganglia unchanged from the previous exam. There are no
     new areas of territorial infarct or effacement of the sulci.  The ventricles
     and cisterns are stable in appearance.
     
     The osseous structures and soft tissues are unchanged. There is extensive
     opacification of the visualized inferior right maxillary sinus and persistent
     mild opacification of the left-sided mastoid air cells.  Correlation with the
     patient's clinical exam is recommended.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of an acute intracranial pathologic process. No
     interval change since [**3238-5-20**]. Findings were communicated to the housestaff
     caring for the patient at the time of the exam.

     The previously noted opacification in the right upper lobe has resolved.  The
     right heart border seems obscured, and there is evidence of bilateral pleural
     effusion.  There is development of slight pulmonary vascular engorgement,
     which is probably positional, however, slight CHF cannot be ruled out .
     There is no pneumothorax noted.

     INDICATION:  Acute onset shortness of breath and chest pain and hypoxia.
     Question PE.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung apices through
     the lung bases after the administration of 100 cc of Optiray given fast bolus
     per pulmonary CTA protocol.  Multiplanar reconstructions were subsequently
     obtained.
     
     PULMONARY CTA:  A good bolus of contrast is identified in the pulmonary
     arterial tree.  There are no filling defects through the subsegmental level to
     suggest pulmonary embolism.  There are no regions of focal dilatation.  The
     bronchi appear patent through the subsegmental level.
     
     In the interval since the prior study, there is increase in focal
     consolidation with air bronchograms in the right lower lobe with an adjacent
     small right pleural effusion.  In addition, opacification is present in the
     right middle lung which may represent fluid tracking along a fissure.  Patchy
     atelectasis is noted at the left lung base posteriorly but the left side is
     otherwise clear with no pleural effusion.
     
     The heart is enlarged.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The aorta is
     tortuous with multiple focal calcifications as described in previous study.
     
     Limited visualization of the organs of the upper abdomen.  Air is again seen
     in the intrahepatic biliary tree and not appreciably changed since the prior
     study. The visualized portions of the spleen and left kidney are unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Scoliosis and degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
     spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Interval consolidation in right lower lobe with air bronchograms and
     associated small pleural effusion.  This could represent focal lobar pneumonia
     versus atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  In addition, fluid
     appears to be tracking in a fissure adjacent to the right middle lobe.

     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Interval consolidation in right lower lobe with air bronchograms and
     associated small pleural effusion.  This could represent focal lobar pneumonia
     versus atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  In addition, fluid
     appears to be tracking in a fissure adjacent to the right middle lobe.
