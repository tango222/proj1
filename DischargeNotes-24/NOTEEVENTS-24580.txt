Brief Hospital Course:
While on the floor (after FICU)

1.  Biliary Sepsis:  CT belly showed mulitple liver mets, slight 
obstruction of biliary stent and multiple mets at porta hepatis, 
peritoneal carcinamatosis and duodenal compression.  ERCP done 
morning of [**2636-8-10**], which showed re-obstruction [**1-11**] tumor 
compression, in addition to previous stent displacement into the 
right collection system.  2 stents were placed and large amount 
of pus was drained during the procedure.  Pt afebrile while on 
the floor.  His WBC count decreased from 23.1 to 15.1 on 
discharge.  His biliruben continued to decrease to 10.6 on 
discharge, and with the pneumobilia seen on CT [**8-15**], strongly 
suggests the new stents are patent.  His surveilence blood cx's 
from [**8-14**] were negative as were C.diff X 3.  The pt has remained 
hemodynamically stable, with SBP's in the 120's-130's. Pt was 
treated with IV levofloxacin, until [**7-14**], when he was switched to 
IV Zosyn, for fear of possible ongoing infection (increasing Cr 
1.7 and increased LDH to the 400's).  However, the pt was 
switched to PO levofloxacin and flagyll proir to discharge.  Pt 
to follow up in GI clinic here at [**Hospital1 25**] Tuesday, [**8-23**] at 
1:pm with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 5637**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4692**].  

2.  ARF:  Likely pre-renal [**1-11**] decreased effective arterial 
volume in the face of sepsis.  Pt now tolerating PO very well, 
and has been encouraged to drink plenty of fluids as an outpt 
(no cardiac hx).  Cr 1.6 on discharge.

3.  Colon Cancer:  Extensive disease including peritoneal 
carcinamotosis.  Stable and could be the source of his high LDH. 
 Repeat CT of the belly [**8-14**] revealed pneumobilia, ""stable"" 
peritoneal carcinamotosis (unchanged from previous study), no 
evidence of biliary or bowel obstruction.  Pt's cough may be 
related to pulmonary metastatic disease, and his liver mets are 
likely contributing to his elevated LFT's.  Pt to schedule f/u 
with his primary oncologist Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 5638**] at [**Hospital3 1722**].

4.  FEN:  Pt tolerating good PO, no nausea or vomiting.  He 
appears adequately hydrated and was advised to keep himself 
hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.  
 
Discharge Medications:
1. Levaquin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day for 
2 weeks.
Disp:*14 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Metastatic colon cancer with obstructive jaundice.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis performed before and
     after the intravenous administration of 150 cc of Optiray. Nonionic contrast
     was used due to patient debility. Imaging was performed without contrast and
     with arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases of enhancement. Additional
     reformatted imaging in the coronal plane was also performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: Atelectasis is present within
     both lung bases as well as tiny bilateral pleural effusions. Intra-abdominal
     ascites is present. There is evidence of nodular enhancement within the
     peritoneum indicating peritoneal carcinomatosis. No free air is seen within
     the abdomen. There are multiple low-attenuation lesions identified within the
     liver. A focal low-attenuation lesion with peripheral enhancement within the
     left lobe of the liver is identified which measures 5.9 x 2.9 cm. There is
     significant intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation which may be slightly more
     prominent within the left lobe of the liver. There are multiple low-
     attenuation lesions within both lobes of the liver that have an appearance
     consistent with metastatic disease. The largest lesion within segment IV on
     series 3B, image 84, measures 3.2 x 2.5 cm. The portal vein and hepatic venous
     system are patent. The hepatic portion of the IVC is compressed by a mass
     within the caudate lobe on series 3B, image 79. There are multiple low
     attenuation masses in the porta hepatis surrounding the second portion of the
     duodenum, the extrahepatic biliary system, and the extrahepatic portal venous
     system. A stent extends from the right central intrahepatic biliary system
     into the common duct. This stent does not extend to the distal common duct
     into the second portion of the duodenum. The spleen is within normal limits.
     The pancreas enhances homogeneously with no pancreatic ductal dilatation. The
     splenic vein, SMA, and SMV are patent. The adrenal glands and kidneys are
     normal in appearance.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The patient is status post partial colectomy.
     An ileostomy extends to the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. There is free
     fluid within the pelvis. There is a soft tissue mass within the presacral
     space/ cul de sac which measures 4.8 x 3.2 cm. There is bladder wall
     thickening. This mass within the presacral space extends to the posterior
     aspect of the urinary bladder. Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic lesions.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     REFORMATTED IMAGING: Images reformatted in the coronal plane were essential in
     evaluating this patient's abdomen and pelvis and show intrahepatic biliary
     ductal dilatation and multiple masses in the region of the porta hepatis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with a stent extending from the
     right central intrahepatic system to the distal common duct. Multiple masses
     in the region of the porta hepatis and second portion of the duodenum may
     cause extrinsic compression of the distal common duct near the ampulla.
     2. There is a low-attenuation focus with peripheral enhancement within the
     left lobe of the liver measuring approximately 6 x 3 cm. This area of low
     attenuation could represent abscess, metastatic disease, or a biloma.
     3. Multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver consistent with
     metastatic disease. A lesion within the caudate lobe compresses the
     intrahepatic IVC; however, the hepatic veins, portal venous system, and
     hepatic arterial system appear patent.
     4. Ascites and peritoneal nodular enhancement indicating peritoneal
     carcinomatosis.
     5. Mass within the cul de sac/presacral space with extensive stranding that
     extends to the posterior bladder wall. The bladder wall is uniformly
     thickened.
     6. External compression of the second portion of the duodenum by numerous
     adjacent masses. There is no evidence of gastric dilatation to suggest
     obstruction.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       54 year old man with metastatic colon CA admitted for obstructive jaundice and 
      cholangitis, now s/p biliary stenting but with increasing wbc/hematologic 
      markers of sepsis.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls compare to prior for change in biliary obstruction.                         
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Metastatic colon cancer, now with the obstructive jaundice and
     cholangitis, increased white cell count.  Evaluate for degree of biliary
     obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Coronal and axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired
     helically following the administration of oral and 100 cc of Optiray IV
     contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT scan from [**2636-8-9**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are dependent areas of atelectasis
     but overall, lung aeration is improved compared to [**8-9**].  There are trace
     bilateral pleural effusions.  No pericardial effusion. There is a 13 mm nodule
     in the right lower lobe just above the hemidiaphragm.
     
     Again seen is extensive intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, the degree of
     which is unchanged since the previous study.  There are two new biliary stents
     present, one is in the left hepatic duct, the other is in the distal common
     bile duct, bridging the area from the inferior aspect of the previously
     inserted stent to the duodenum.  Air is present within the biliary tree and
     gallbladder, likely indicative of stent functioning or recent instrumentation.
     Note is made that the anastomosis of the previous stent with distal CBD stent,
     the most superior aspect of the newly inserted stent appears slightly
     narrowed. There is no change in the appearance of multiple low attenuation
     lesions throughout the liver.  The degree of IVC compression is unchanged
     allowing for the differences in technique.  The stent bridges the multiple low
     attenuation lesions within the porta hepatis, and does not appear narrowed at
     this level.
     
     Again seen are cardiophrenic lymph nodes. There is slight fullness in the left
     adrenal gland which is only seen on one image. The degree of ascites and
     nodular enhancement in the peritoneum is unchanged. There is no evidence of
     bowel obstruction. Again seen is a left lower quadrant ostomy. There is no
     evidence of renal obstruction. The spleen is unchanged in size.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen is a moderate amount of ascitic
     fluid within the pelvis, the amount of which is not changed significantly. The
                                                                 (Over)

     large presacral soft tissue attenuation material is unchanged.  The bladder is
     unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes are
     seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are
     identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interval insertion of two billiary stents, one in the left hepatic duct,
     the other in the common bile duct bridging the inferior aspect of the
     previously present stent to the duodenum.  There is new pneumobilia, which
     could be secondary to a patent stent or recent instrumentation.  No change in
     the degree of biliary dilatation. No new intraabdominal abscess.
     2.  Unchanged appearance of multiple metastatic foci.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  54-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer and biliary
     obstruction; now with persistent fevers.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases through
     the symphysis pubis following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray.
     Nonionic contrast was used due to patient history of allergies.
     
     COMPARISON:  09/2004.
     
     CT ABDOMEN w/ IV CONTRAST:  Visualized lung bases demonstrate minor dependent
     atelectatic changes and trace bilateral pleural effusions.  There are at least
     four (4) right lower lobe pulmonary nodules, two (2) of which measure 1 cm in
     size. There is a small left lower lobe pulmonary nodule as well.  The heart
     appears grossly normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  Two (2)
     pericardial lymph nodes and a right internal mammary lymph node are again
     noted.  As before, the liver demonstrates numerous low attenuation lesions, in
     keeping with known metastatic disease.  Two (2) biliary stents are again
     noted.  There is a stable degree of moderate biliary ductal dilatation, as
     well as a few small foci of pneumobilia.  The portal vein and its branches
     appear patent at this time.  The gallbladder is collapsed.  The spleen,
     pancreas, kidneys, and right adrenal gland appear grossly normal.  As before,
     there is a nodular prominence of the medial limb of the left adrenal gland.
     The visualized loops of bowel appear grossly normal.  There is a moderate
     amount of free ascites in the abdomen and pelvis, unchanged since the prior
     study.  There is extensive lymphadenopathy in the perisplenic, peripancreatic,
     portal, and mesenteric regions.  In addition, there is omental thickening,
     consistent with tumor implants.  The aorta and its major intraabdominal
     branches appear patent. There is narrowing of the intrahepatic portion of the
     IVC, unchanged.  No free intraabdominal air is identified.
     
     CT PELVIS w/ IV CONTRAST:  A left lower quadrant ostomy is again noted.  The
     bladder is collapsed and appears thickened.  There is stable soft tissue
     prominence to the presacral space at the site of surgical resection,
     consistent with disease involvement.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified within
     the visualized osseous structures.
     
                                                                 (Over)
