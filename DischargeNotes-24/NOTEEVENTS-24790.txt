Admission Date:  [**2686-11-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2686-11-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2587-3-9**]       Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man
who was found on the floor the morning of admission by his
family having fallen out of bed sometime during the night,
unclear if there was loss of consciousness.  He states he
felt dizzy and could not get up off the floor.  He was taken
to an outside hospital where a head CT showed a right sided
acute on chronic subdural hematoma 1 to 2 cm.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pleasant elderly gentleman in no acute
distress.  His pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
 Extraocular movements intact.  Neck was supple.  He had no
midline tenderness.  Chest was clear bilaterally.  Cardiac S1
and S2.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities erythema and some edema
bilaterally of the lower extremities left greater then right.
Neurologically awake, alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II
through XII were intact.  Pupils are 2 mm and reactive.
Extraocular movements intact.  Face, he had a left facial
droop and a left drift.  His strength was 5 out of 5 in all
muscle groups on the Right and 5-/5 on the Left.  Reflexes are 2+
and symmetric. Sensation was
intact to light touch. 

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the Trauma CICU and was
taken to the Operating Room on [**2686-11-4**] after having some
neurological deterioration with a more pronounced left facial
droop and left side weakness.  He tolerated the surgery well
without
complications.  He had a right bur hole drainage times two
with placement of a JP drain.  Postoperatively, he was awake,
alert and oriented to person, following commands with a left
facial droop, able to raise the left arm upward.  His grasp
was 5 out of 5.  His IPs on the right were 4+ on the left
were 4.  He was somewhat agitated with elevated blood
pressures immediately postoperative.  His vital signs
remained stable.  On [**2686-11-5**] he had a repeat head CT,
which showed good evacuation of the subdural hematoma and
then around 2:00 p.m. on [**11-5**] the patient had an episode of
respiratory distress with supraventricular tachycardia and
question of seizure activity.  The patient was immediately
intubated and sedated and had a femoral A line placed.  He
was hemodynamically unstable with drop in blood pressure and
a Dopamine drip was started.  The patient was also given
Metoprolol intravenously for his supraventricular
tachycardia, which dropped his heart rate.  Cardiology was
consulted on [**2686-11-6**] for episodes of recurrent
supraventricular tachycardia.  He was on a Diltiazem drip.
The patient underwent cardiac ablation for his
supraventricular tachycardia with good results and resolution
of his supraventricular tachycardia.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well.  He was extubated on [**2686-11-7**] following
commands times four with diffuse weakness.  Pupils were 2
down to 1.5 and his incision was clean, dry and intact.  He
moved his feet to command and withdrew to lower stimulation,
squeeze bilateral arm.  He was transferred to the regular
floor on [**2686-11-11**] where he remained neurologically stable,
awake, alert and oriented times one to two, moving all
extremities with good strength following commands times four.
Episodes of some confusion requiring placement of a Posey
restraints _, which has now been discontinued.  He is out of bed
to the chair, tolerating a regular diet.  Physical therapy
and occupational therapy have seen him and felt he will
require a rehab prior to discharge to home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 hours prn.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q 24 hours.
3.  Famotidine 20 mg po b.i.d.
4.  Heparin 5000 units subq q 12 hours.
5.  Hydralazine 25 mg po q 8 hours hold for systolic blood
pressure less then 100.
6.  Artificial tears one to two drops q 6 hours prn.
7.  Insulin sliding scale.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient's condition is stable at
the time of discharge.  He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 261**] in one month with a repeat head CT.

     INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with poor oxygen saturation, evaluate for PE. He
     is recently postop.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images were performed through the pulmonary vascularity after
     the administration of intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images
     were obtained. Please note the extreme lung apices and bases are not included
     on the images.
     
     CONTRAST: 100 cc of Optiray was administered due to fast bolus rate required
     for this study.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST: No pulmonary emboli are identified. There is a prominent
     prevasular lymph node which measures 13 mm in short axis. There are scattered
     small mediastinal lymph nodes. There are small hilar lymph nodes. There is no
     axillary lymphadenopathy. There is fluid diffusely throughout the esophagus
     and an air-fluid level within the upper esophagus. This can predispose to
     aspiration. There is a heterogeneous nodule within the right lobe of the
     thyroid gland. There are coarse coronary artery calcifications and
     cardiomegaly. The thoracic aorta is markedly ectatic with irregularity of its
     wall. There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions. There is compressive
     atelectasis at the lung bases. There is respiratory motion limiting the
     evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma but no major consolidations are seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images support the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No PE.
     2. Fluid within the esophagus. This increases the patient's risk for
     aspiration.
     3. Nodular density in the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
     4. Compressive atelectasis at the lung bases.

     INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with new mental status changes since the prior
     scan. Evaluate for new intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON: Head CT from [**2686-11-5**] at 11:21.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS: Again there is a catheter within the right subdural space, unchanged
     in configuration. There is no new hemorrhage. There is a small amount of
     subdural collection with mixed attenuation, not changed from the prior study.
     There is no new hemorrhage. There is stable mass effect on the brain. There is
     no shift of normally midline structures. The amount of subdural air is
     unchanged.
     
     There is mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells. Presumably related to
     the patient's intubation. There are burr holes in the left frontal and
     parietal bone.
     
     IMPRESSION: No significant change from the prior exam. No acute hemorrhage.

     COMMENT: Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared with
     the previous study at 1:23 PM.
     
     The tip of the right subclavian IV catheter is identified going toward
     cranially in the internal jugular vein. The information was communicated with
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6091**].
     
     The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified 2 cm above the carina.
     
     There is continued moderate pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly and small
     bilateral pleural effusion indicating congestive heart failure. There is
     continued atelectasis in both lower lobes.
     
     Again note is made of marked tortuousity of the thoracic aorta with
     calcification. No pneumothorax is identified.

Event Note:

AT approximately 1240 pt developed rapid SVT in 160s and was currently sleeping, BP into the 200s. Pt awoken and given HAldol given no effect. 5 mg lopressor was given with a brief break in SR then immediately back into rapid SVT 130s-160s. Pt extremely agitated, sats dropping, placed on 100% non rebreather, STAT ABG pbtained. MOre Haldol and Lopressor given. Trauma SICU attending called to bed side and remained. Midaz given. Pt appeared to be having a seizure but was communicating. Pt more and more tachypneic. STAT EKG, CXR obtained. Pt very fidgety, picking at everything. HR dropped into the 50s into a Junctional BRady with PVCS. Hr dropped, unable to obtain via NBP. PAlpable BP obtained Syst 90. Dopamine started/ NIPride off, FLuid given, PT bagged and rapidly intubated. Right subclavian triple lumen obtained and CXR verified placement, and left femoral ALINE placed and zeroed. 

Review of systems: 

NEURO:  Prior to event pt was communicating with garbled speech, MAE X 4, good strength. PERRL, followed commands consistently. Was restrained both arms soft wrist for pt safety, picking at lines. After event pt sedated on 60 mcg/kg/min of propofol. Pt withdraws all 4 extremites to nailbed pain. Pupils are 2mm/bsk and equally reactive. +gag, +cough, +corneals.

CV: Prior to event pt in a NSR with occasioinal PVCS. DUring event pt increased into a rapid SVT 160s. After even pt in a Junctional Brady to JR 50s-60s with occasional PVCS. Arterial line in left femoral artery with good waveform. Goal to keep systolic between 110-140s. BP has been very labile since event going up and down on the dopamine for pressure support. DP/PT pulses present bilaterally and weak to palpation. Skin is warm to touch. Pt received Metoprolol and takes Digoxin. MIVF at 60/hour.

PUlmonary: prior ot event pt was on RA with sats 95-98%. During event pt became more tachypneic and sats decreased. Currently pt intubated on SIMV mode: 600 x 14, 50%, 5 of PS. O2 sats 99%, not overbreathing vent. Lung sounds are clear to coarse bilaterally. Good cough. Suctioning returns small thin secretions. ABGS show adequate oxygenation, see labs for details.

GI: Belly is soft, nontender, + BS. NPO

GU: Foley patent to gravity, adequate UOP. 

Heme: Crit stable see labs for details.

ID: Afebrile, started on Oxacillin.

Social: Family in prior to event. Post event another family member visited and was updated by trauma attending.

Plan: To go to CT this afternoon, To Angio, COntinue to titrate Dopa to maintain adequate syst BP, Monitor sedation, follow Neuro exam, Follow and replenish lytes.

     Hazy areas of increased density persist at both lung bases, suggesting
     bilateral pleural effusions. Note that these limit evaluation of the lung

Pt returned from cath lab approx 1830 s/p ablation. Pt stable overnight, sedated on propofol.

ROS:
Neuro: Pt sedated on propofol most of night, propofol off occasionally to do full neuro assessment, however restarted each time due to pt not tolerating vent and unstable BP (high). Pt wakes to voice, off of propofol will MAE and follow commands. Extremities weak but equal. Pupils 3-4mm and briskly reactive, pt with strong cough and gag.  Pt continues on dilantin, no siezure activity noted, levels to be drawn in AM.  Incisions CD+I with staples.

Resp: Pt kept intubated overnight, remains on vent. Lungs coarse, dimished in bilateral bases. Pt suctioned for large ammts thick yellowish tan sputum. ETT rotated and retaped.  ABG adequate. Pt overbreathing vent when awake, then begins to auto-peep, unable to ventilate so propofol kept on.

CV: Per report from cath lab, pt with AV ablation with success, no need for pacer [**Name6 (MD) 59**] cardiology MD.  HR 70-80's all night, no ectopy noted.  Pt had R groin approach in angio, site CD+I with bandaid. L groin with a-line, site also intact.  R IJ TLC site intact, pt with 1 periph IV. Extremities warm with palpable pulses. Pt continues on p-boots, SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  Nipride gtt on and off to maintain SBP <180. 

GI: Abd soft, +flatus -BM tonight.  Good BS throughout. TF resumed via oral pedi feeding tube. Pt continues on pepcid.

OOB to chair w/ stand and pivot - he did weight bear w/ 2 assist, but didn't move his legs to  move toward the chair (BTB via slideboard as he was too weak/unsteady to stand).  Took custard w/ his pill ok, as well as sips of H20 w/ no coughing/choking.  Not able to feed himself. Family in - niece and nephew. They state that pt was independent and working at a local fruit and vegetable farm prior to the fall.  Given pt's age, they decided on DNR/DNI status.

No SVT noted.  If pt had episodes of SVT, plan is for EP to see him again.  +periph pulses, no edema, extrems warm. 

Resp:  50% FT on in am - changed to 6l n/p when up in chair and continued to sat high 90s.  Down to 5l at this time.  Lungs very diminished bilat.  Good cough effort - non-productive.

GI/GU:  Abd soft, non-tender, +BS, no BM.  Took cup of custard and sips H20 w/ crushed pill.  May have house diet.  Foley cath w/ yellow urien w/ sediment.   u/o=50-80cc/hr.

Pain:  pt denies any pain.

Anitbx:  afebrile - levaquin.

Skin:  rash remains on torso, back and thighs.  Head incision/staples intact.  

Access:  L fem a-line d/c'd prior to OOB.  LIJ TLC intact.

Social:  Niece and nephew in to see pt - updated on pt's status.

Plan:  If pt stable off nipride, may tx to floor.  Continue to monitor neuro/cardiac/resp status.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male S/P evacuation of right subdural hematoma.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**2686-11-5**] and [**2686-11-4**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT
     
     CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There has been interval removal of right subdural
     catheter.  The pneumocephalus seen on the prior study within the right
     subdural space is no longer present without signs of any new intracranial air.
     There remains a right subdural fluid collection which has become more
     hypoattenuated when compared to previous exam. This is consistent with
     degradation of blood products.  The overall size of the subdural hematoma on
     the right is unchanged. The mass effect upon the right parietal lobe is also
     unchanged.  There is also a hypodense crescentic area over the left
     frontal/parietal lobe which is unchanged from the previous exam, and most
     likely represents a left-sided subdural hematoma.  There is no evidence of
     hydrocephalus or shift of normally mid-line structures.  There are no new
     hemorrhages or intracranial mass lesions.  The periventricular small vessel
     ischemia, as well as an old lacunar infarct within the right thalamus is
     unchanged.  Burr holes are seen within the left frontal and parietal bones.
     The rest of the surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right subdural catheter and resorption
     of pneumocephalus.  Stable appearance in right subdural hematoma, and stable
     appearance in what most likely represents a left-sided subdural hematoma.
