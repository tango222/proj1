constipation.  Present medications include Mavik, lactulose,
hydrochlorothiazide, Proscar and multivitamins.  He is not
allergic to any medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well developed gentleman,
temperature is 98.9.  He is awake and alert, nontoxic

tenderness and positive bowel sounds.  Rectal examination
showed normal tone without any stool.  There was trace guaiac
positive mucus.  Extremities notable for venous stasis
changes.

potassium 3.1, chloride of 90, BUN of 30, creatinine of 1.0,
glucose of 166, hematocrit of 34.5, white blood cell count of
14,000.  KUB showed multiple dilated loops of bowel, both in
the colon and in the small bowel.

constipation, question intestinal obstruction.  He was made
n.p.o.  He was seen in consultation by the gastrointestinal

possibility with the hypokalemia.  The potassium was
repleted. A barium was performed which showed a mass of the
splenic flexure.  The patient was then seen in consultation
by the surgical service where he was prepared for surgery.
On [**2589-7-31**] he underwent a subtotal colectomy with findings of
very dilated colon.  A primary anastomosis was performed.  In
the operating room he developed a supraventricular
tachycardia which was broken with magnesium and become more
hypoxic requiring PEEP.  Postoperatively he was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for telemetry.  He required
ventilation for several days.  He was begun on total
parenteral nutrition.  He continued to be weaned on the
ventilator and was begun on antibiotics for question of
pneumonia.  He was extubated on [**2589-8-5**].  He continued to
need some significant pulmonary toilet.  Bowels seemed to
open up and he was progressed to diet.  His total parenteral
nutrition was discontinued.  He was then discharged on
[**2589-8-12**].

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.      Obstructing colon cancer.
2.      Supraventricular tachycardia.
3.      Hypokalemia.
4.      History of benign prostatic hypertrophy.
5.      Hypertension.

SURGICAL PROCEDURES:
Subtotal colectomy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol with codeine for pain, Mavik,
hydrochlorothiazide, Proscar.
