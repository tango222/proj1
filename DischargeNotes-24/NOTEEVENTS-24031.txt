potassium 5.2, chloride 89, bicarbonate 14, BUN 122,
creatinine 6.2, ALT 21, AST 39, alkaline phosphatase 266,
amylase 88, total bilateral 20.2, LDH 346, CK 47, calcium
7.8, phosphorous 7.4, magnesium 2.8.  Arterial blood gases on
admission:  pH 7.3, pCO2 24, pO2 82, bicarbonate 12.
Ultrasound:  Dilated intrahepatic ducts, common bile duct
cannot be assessed, gallbladder with sludge.  CT of the
abdomen:  Dilated common bile duct at 20 mm, dilated
intrahepatic ducts.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 61 year old male with
multiple medical problems, including AIDS, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, pancreatitis, adrenal
insufficiency, and colectomy for diverticulitis, who now
presents with acute renal failure and biliary obstruction,
probable cholecystitis with obstruction and cholangitis.

1.  Liver/infectious disease:  The patient had an increased
bilirubin and jaundice, consistent with an obstructive
biliary process and cholangitis.  He was started on
vancomycin and Zosyn for sepsis.  Blood cultures grew out
Klebsiella.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography on [**2675-11-16**] which showed
distal common bile duct stricture due to mass lesion, distal
common bile duct obstruction, suppurative cholangitis,
choledochoduodenal fistula, nonfilling of the gallbladder,
stent placement in the common bile duct, peri-ampullary
diverticulum, pancreatic duct was not injected.

The patient was continued on antibiotics and, when the
sensitivities of the Klebsiella came back sensitive to
ceftriaxone, the patient was switched to intravenous
ceftriaxone and vancomycin was discontinued.  The patient
continued to be afebrile on ceftriaxone for several days,
which was then switched to oral Levaquin and Flagyl which was
added.

Post stenting, the patient's bilirubin trended down
significantly over the next several days and his jaundice
also improved.  He continued to be afebrile.  The patient
will need stent removal in four to six weeks from [**2675-11-16**] for re-evaluation of the bile duct obstruction.

2.  Renal:  The patient had acute tubular necrosis secondary
to hypotension and sepsis, which gradually resolved over the
several days of his stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was hydrated and his creatinine gradually
improved into the range of 2, and his electrolytes were
repleted accordingly as the acute tubular necrosis entered a
diuresis phase, which the patient is still in at the time of
discharge.

3.  HIV:  The patient was discontinued on HAART medication as
he felt that he was unable to tolerate the medications and
just stopped taking all of his HAART medications as well as
his prophylaxis.  After much discussion, it was decided that
he should not be placed back on these medications, as he is
unlikely to be compliant, but may benefit at some point in
the future from restarting them.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient has adrenal insufficiency and was
started on stress dosed steroids, which will be tapered from
Prednisone 40 mg daily on [**2675-11-22**] to 30 mg p.o.q.d.
on [**2675-11-21**] with a decrease of 10 mg each day until a
level of 7.5 mg daily is reached, at which dose the patient
will remain on.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Common bile duct obstruction secondary to mass suspicious
for biliary duct carcinoma.
2.  Sepsis.
3.  Acute tubular necrosis.
4.  HIV/AIDS.
5.  Adrenal insufficiency.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is somewhat
deconditioned on discharge, as he has gone through several
fairly significant illnesses, and will need a stay in a short
term rehabilitation facility for improvement of his
ambulation and his oral intake prior to returning home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
MS Contin 15 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d.
Prednisone 30 mg p.o.q.d., then 20 mg p.o.q.d., then 10 mg
p.o.q.d., each for one day, and then 7.5 mg p.o.q.d. standing
dose.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.q.d.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.t.i.d.
Ambien 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n.
Tylenol 650 mg p.o./p.r.q.6h.p.r.n.

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN [**2675-11-15**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  61 year old man with gross intrahepatic ductal
     dilatation identified on liver ultrasound.  Abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the iliac crests without the administration of IV contrast.
     No IV contrast was administered as the patient has an elevated creatinine.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Reference is made to the patient's recent abdominal ultrasound.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is atelectasis versus scarring
     at the lung bases.  As on the ultrasound, there is marked intrahepatic ductal
     dilatation in both right and left lobes of the liver, perhaps slightly more
     pronounced in the left lobe.  The extrahepatic common duct is also markedly
     dilated, measuring up to 2.5 cm in diameter.  It does appear to taper in the
     region of the pancreatic head.  No obstructing stone is identified in this
     region.  The gallbladder is distended.  No intraluminal stones are seen.  The
     gallbladder wall does not appear abnormally thickened.  There are
     calcifications throughout the length of the pancreas.  The pancreatic duct
     does not appear abnormally dilated.  There is separation of the calcifications
     within the head of the pancreas suggesting there may be a mass in this region.
     The adrenal glands and spleen are normal. The kidneys are symmetric in size
     without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal stones. There are at least two
     cysts associated with the right kidney.  The stomach is dilated with fluid and
     gas. There is a trace amount of free fluid inferior to the liver.  There are
     multiple surgical clips present along the anterior abdominal wall on the
     right.  There are degenerative changes of the osseous structures but no
     destructive bone lesions are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION: Marked intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation to the
     level of the pancreatic head. Possible mass in the head of the pancreas where
     there is separation of the pancreatic calcifications. Consider MRCP or ERCP
     for further evaluation.

     FINDINGS:  An ERCP was performed in GI suite by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1772**]. Evaluation of the
     biliary tree reveals a moderately long stricture of the common bile duct with
     marked dilatation of the intra and extrahepatic bile duct upstream from this
     stricture.  Note is made of calcifications medial to the duodenum consistent
     with calcifications in the head of the pancreas.  No filling defects are
     identified within the biliary tree. The patient underwent placement of stent
     in the common bile duct.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Distal common bile duct stricture with marked intra and extrahepatic ductal
     dilatation above the level of the stricture. Given the presence of
     calcifications in the head of the pancreas, the differential diagnosis
     includes an inflammatory stricture secondary to chronic pancreatis vs. a
     neoplastic process.

     Reason: R/O Neoplastic biliary obstruction
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      61 year old man with HIV and known biliary stricture with plastic stent in
      place. Now with fever and jaundice. 
      Exam performed [**2676-2-22**], req submitted [**2676-2-23**]
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R/O Neoplastic biliary obstruction
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     History of AIDS with biliary stricture and stent placement now presents with
     fever and jaundice.
     
     The preliminary film demonstrates a double pigtail biliary stent in the right
     upper quadrant. Following removal of the stent there is  contrast filling of
     the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right hepatic duct and several
     divisions of the right hepatic duct. The left hepatic duct is not
     demonstrated. Cystic duct and gallbladder are not demonstrated.
     There is dilatation of the visualized portion of the common bile duct and more
     proximal ducts on the available spot films. The distal end of the common bile
     duct is probably narrowed but not clearly delineated on the film. There is
     some contrast filling of the distal end of the pancreatic duct on the initial
     film. Status post placement of metal-wall stent in common bile duct.
     
     IMPRESSION: Status post removal of indwelling plastic biliary stent. Presumed
     stricture distal end of common bile duct with dilatation of the visualized
     ducts proximal to this. The left hepatic duct is not demonstrated. Status post
     placement of metal-wall stent in common bile duct.

     INDICATION: 61 y/o male with AIDS. Patient with fever. Evaluate for pulmonary
     infiltrate in patient on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5479**].
     
     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior radiograph from [**2675-11-16**].
     
     The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The
     pulmonary vascularity is normal. The lungs are clear with no evidence of
     parenchymal consolidation or pulmonary nodules. There are no pleural
     effusions. There is no pneumothorax. There is evidence of degenerative change
     within the lower thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.
