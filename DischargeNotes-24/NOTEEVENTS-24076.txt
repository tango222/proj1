Admission Date:  [**3226-5-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**3226-5-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**3172-9-13**]     Sex:  M

Service:

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Intertrochanteric hip fracture.
2.  Aspiration pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname **] is a
53-year-old with Alzheimer's dementia who lives in a group
home.  He was found to be ambulating with difficult yesterday
with some pain in his right hip.  His care takers noted that
he was unable to bear weight on his right lower extremity and
brought him to the Emergency [**Hospital1 **].  There was no
documentation of a traumatic fall.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history includes)
1.  Down syndrome.
2.  Alzheimer's.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Seborrhea.
5.  Depression.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Levoxyl 100 mg p.o. q.d.,
Paxil 25 mg p.o. q.d., vitamin B, vitamin C, and Ensure.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in a group home.  No alcohol.  No
tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Temperature on
admission was 94.9, heart rate was 81, blood pressure
was 117/55, respiratory rate was 16.  He had an oxygen
saturation of 96% on room air.  He was alert and cooperative,
in no acute distress.  He was following simple commands.  His
lungs were clear to auscultation.  He had a regular rate and
rhythm.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
His left lower extremity demonstrated a 2+ dorsalis pedis.
Light touch was intact in both lower extremities.  His right
lower extremity was flexed  and externally rotated.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission included a white blood cell count of 16.8, with a
hematocrit of 44.  His had normal electrolytes with a
potassium of 3.8 and a sodium of 141.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   His electrocardiogram was normal.

A chest x-ray was pending.

Hip demonstrated a garden 4 femoral neck fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**5-1**].  He
was also seen and evaluated by his primary care physician
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4548**]).  He received medical clearance.

On [**3226-5-1**] he underwent a bipolar hemiarthroplasty
without incident.  His postoperative course was remarkable
for the development of respiratory distress noted on
postoperative day two.  The patient developed a respiratory
rate of 40 with room air saturations in the 80s with an
increase in pressure, with a temperature of 100.2.  The
patient was placed on a 100% nonrebreather with saturations
of 97%.  A chest x-ray at that time demonstrated evidence of
a right lower lobe pneumonia.  The patient was then placed on
levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and followed by that team.

On [**3226-5-4**], the patient improved and was weaned off the
nonrebreather to cool nebulizers.  He was febrile to 101.6;
and once again was monitored by the Medical Intensive Care
Unit team.  He improved; however, he did have a hematocrit
drop to 23.  The patient was on Lovenox postoperatively.
Because of this, he was transfused 2 units.  He was
guaiac-negative.  The Lovenox was then discontinued.

The patient did have lower extremity noninvasive tests
performed on [**3226-5-5**].  These were negative, and because
of this negative examination, the patient had his Lovenox and
Coumadin stopped and was placed on an aspirin per day.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/STATUS:  The patient was then
discharged back to his group home on [**3226-5-8**] with
appropriate treatment.  He was partial weightbearing on his
right lower extremity at the time of discharge.  He was
afebrile with stable vital signs and a normal white count.
His pneumonia was managed by the Medicine Service.  The
patient was discharged on levofloxacin.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Subcapital femoral fracture.
2.  Aspiration pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included)
 1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (for seven days).
 2.  Percocet as needed.
 3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 4.  Levoxyl 100 mg p.o. q.d.
 5.  Vitamin B one tablet p.o. q.d.
 6.  Vitamin C one tablet p.o. q.d.
 7.  Ensure 8 ounces p.o. b.i.d.
 8.  Dexamethasone ointment.
 9.  Nizoral shampoo daily for his seborrhea.
10.  Debrox 3 to 4 drops every week for a wax buildup.
11.  Paxil 25 mg p.o. q.d.

     Compared to the study of [**3226-5-3**] at 20:58, there is a persistent left lower
     lobe opacity consistent with pneumonia.  The pulmonary vessels remain okay.
     The heart size is within normal limits.  There is apparent deviation of the
     trachea to the right superiorly, but given lack of findings on CT of the
     previous day, this likely represents a positional artifact.  There is blunting
     of the left CPA, suggesting a small left-sided pleural effusion.  The right
     lung and right CPA are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     INDICATION:  Evalute for DVT in patient following surgery.
     
     FINDINGS:  Noninvasive vascular ultrasound studies were performed in the left
     and right lower extremities.  On the left side, the common and superficial
     femoral veins and the popliteal vein are widely patent with flow which is
     augmentable.  All veins are compressible on the left side.  On the right side,
     the common femoral, saphenous and proximal superficial femoral vein and
     popliteal vein are all widely patent, with augmentation and compressibility.
     The mid and distal superficial femoral veins could not be visualized due to
     overlying cast.  In discussion with the patient's nurse, it was decided not to
     remove the cast for the study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No DVT in left or right lower extremity.  Please note that the
     mid and distal superficial femoral vein on the right was not imaged due to
     overlying cast.

     CT OF THE PELVIS.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  53 year old man with Down syndrome.  Status post right
     hip arthroplasty.  Now with gram-positive cocci septicemia.  Evaluate for
     infection of the prosthetic hip.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
     the pelvis to the upper femurs following the administration of 100 cc of
     Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray contrast was utilized in light of debility.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is status post placement of a
     metallic right hip prosthesis.  The artifact caused by this metallic hardware
     renders evaluation of the right hip joint space impossible.  However, the
     muscles surrounding the right hip appear symmetric in comparison with the left
     and no abnormal fluid collections are identified anterior or posterior to the
     hip prosthesis and the fat planes between the muscles are well preserved.
     There is a small amount of stranding in the subcutaneous fat adjacent to the
     hip.  There are a few small lymph nodes in the inguinal regions bilaterally
     which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
     
     The urinary bladder, rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Artifact caused by right metallic hip prosthesis obscures the
     right hip joint and thus it is impossible to evaluate for fluid within the
     joint space.  However, there is no suggestion of abnormal fluid collection in
     the surrounding soft tissues.

     dementia.  Recently hospitalized with ?sepsis.  Right hip pain.
     
     After discussion with the patient's housekeeper and by phone with patient's
     sister ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 15357**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15358**]) a right hip aspiration was performed uneventfully
     (this procedure was originally scheduled as in-patient). Absentee consent form
     signed.  Preliminary fluoroscopy shows a satisfactorily positioned non-
     cemented bipolar right hip hemiarthroplasty.  A needle was introduced into
     several places along the metallic femoral neck of the prosthesis and 0.3 ml of
     sanguinous ""effusion"" was aspirated.  No large collection identified.  The
     patient tolerated the procedure with no difficulty.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Only several drops normal appearing fluid obtained from area of
     prosthesis. This was sent for culture.
