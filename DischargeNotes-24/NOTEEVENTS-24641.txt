Admission Date:  [**2822-11-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2822-11-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2751-5-4**]       Sex:  M

Service:  BLUE SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male with
a past medical history of duodenal ulcer bleeding, who
presented with a chief complaint of two days of orthostasis,
fatigue and malaise with dark and tarry stools on [**2822-11-12**] to the [**Hospital1 4**]
Emergency Room.  The patient reportedly denied nausea,
vomiting, hematemesis, bright red blood per rectum, or
syncope.  The patient, however, did note fatigue, weakness
and orthostasis.  The patient reportedly contacted Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2822-11-12**], after realizing that his
symptoms were consistent with a prior episode of duodenal
ulcer bleeding.  The patient was subsequently referred to the
[**Hospital1 4**] Emergency Room and
admitted on [**2822-11-12**], for workup of suspected upper
gastrointestinal bleed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], coronary artery
disease, hypertension, gout, depression, basal cell and
squamous cell carcinoma, duodenal ulcer with repeated bleeds,
status post splenectomy, status post right coronary artery
stent, status post multiple skin biopsies, status post
appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Protonix, aspirin, hydroxyurea,
Procardia, fexofenadine, allopurinol.

ALLERGIES:  Tetracycline.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, blood pressure
112/51, heart rate 57, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation
95% on room air.  The patient was noted to be normocephalic,
atraumatic, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  The patient had moist mucous membranes and a
clear oropharynx, no lymphadenopathy or jugular venous
distention was noted, and no carotid bruits were noted
bilaterally.  Heart examination demonstrated a regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1 S2, and a II/VI systolic murmur.
Respiratory examination demonstrated lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally, with diminished sounds at the
bases.  Abdominal examination was soft, with minimal
protuberance, nontender, no palpable masses.  Rectal
examination demonstrated brown stool, strongly guaiac
positive, no palpable masses, and normal tone.  Extremities
were warm and well perfused, with no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  Neurologic examination was alert and oriented x 3,
appropriate.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.1, hematocrit
23.6, platelet count 780.  Sodium 134, potassium 5.4,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 20, BUN 47, creatinine 1.6, glucose
46.  A previously-drawn Helicobacter pylori test was antibody
negative.  PT 12.7, PTT 29.2, INR 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Blue
Surgery service on [**2822-11-12**], under the direction of
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with a presumptive diagnosis of upper
gastrointestinal bleeding.  The patient was admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close hemodynamic
monitoring, and was immediately transfused two units of
packed red blood cells.  An endoscopy conducted the evening
of admission demonstrated a normal esophagus, melena in the
antrum and stomach body, and a single acute cratered bleeding
7 mm ulcer in the distal bulb of the duodenum, with edema of
the surrounding walls and a narrowing of the lumen.  Ten 1 cc
epinephrine 1:10,000 injections were applied for hemostasis,
with success.  [**Hospital1 **]-cap electrocautery was applied for
hemostasis successfully.  The patient was followed with
serial hematocrits every four hours through the evening of
admission, into hospital day number one, during which time
the patient required two additional units of packed red blood
cells to be transfused, resulting in a hematocrit of 27.3 on
the morning of hospital day number one.

Given this inappropriate response to four units of packed red
blood cells transfused, the patient received continuous every
four hour hematocrit checks through hospital day number
three.  The patient subsequently required two additional
units of packed red blood cells and was noted to demonstrate
a stable hematocrit of 31.8 on hospital day number three.

Given the stabilization, the patient was subsequently
transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on the evening of
hospital day number three, with instructions for continued
hematocrit monitoring.  Serial studies conducted throughout
the course of hospital day number three and four demonstrated
stabilization of the patient's hematocrit at approximately
31.7.

On hospital day number four, the patient was advanced to a
regular diet.  His intravenous fluids were discontinued, and
he was transitioned to oral medications.  A follow-up
evaluation by the Gastroenterology service noted the patient
to be doing well, in stable condition, and advised continued
oral Protonix therapy twice daily for at least eight weeks,
with once daily therapy thereafter.  The patient was
subsequently cleared for discharge to home, with instructions
for follow up.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Patient to be discharged to home,
with instructions for follow up.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth twice a day
2.  Sucralfate 1 gram by mouth four times a day

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to observe a planned
non-acidic diet, Sucralfate 1 gram by mouth four times a day,
pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth every 12 hours.  The patient is
to limit physical exercise, no excessive exertion.  The
patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the
outpatient surgical clinic three to four weeks following
discharge.  The patient is to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5770**] to schedule
an appointment.
