Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 147**] 
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, fatigue
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.
 
History of Present Illness:
63 year-old male with follicular lymphoma who was recently 
discharged one week ago after being treated for L3 thecal sac 
compression who now presents with generalized weakness for one 
day prior to admission.  He had been well at rehab until he 
began to feel a generalized fatigue and weakness.  Initially, 
this resolved on its own, but then returned the following day.  
At the time, he denied any fever, chills, lightheadedness, chest 
pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.  He was 
then transfered to the [**Hospital1 25**].  However, during transport, he 
became hypontensive to the 80's systolic, tachycardic to the 
140's, and hypoxemic to the 70's.  He was diverted to [**Hospital1 921**] and was found to have pneumonia on chest x-ray.  He was 
given one dose of ceftriaxone and received 2L of normal saline 
with improvement in vital signs.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 25**].  
In the Emergency Department, he was normotensive, afebrile, and 
his oxygen saturations were in the mid-90's on 4L nasal cannula. 
 He also had an elevated lactate.  He was given vancomycin and 
azithromycin.  He was transfered to the Intensive care unit for 
further care given that he appeared septic since he was 
initially hypotensive with an elevated lactate.  

 
Past Medical History:
Past oncology history: He was diagnosed with low-grade 
follicular lymphoma in [**3374**] when he presented with a large right 
neck mass. He was treated with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy 
followed by 4 cycles of Rituxan. He had a good initial resonse 
to chemotherapy; however, his disease recurred in [**3378**].  He 
underwent 2 more cycles of CHOP followed by CEPP. He was 
subsequently treated with Bexxar radiolabeled antibody and 
attained a complete remission for about 3 years.  In February 
2005, he noted the gradual increase of his right neck mass, 
which showed follicular lymphoma on biopsy.  He underwent [**4-17**] 
cycles of R-CEPP responded well.  This chemotherapy was 
itnerupted secondart to a hip fracture.  He was notd to have 
cervical spine involvement of imaging and was place in a soft 
cervical collar.  He underwent 2 cycles of EPOCH salvage 
chemotherapy in 8/05 and [**9-16**].  He recently was admitted thecal 
sac compression at the L3 level for which he received 10 doses 
of radiation therapy.
.
Past Medical History:
1. Follicular lymphoma as above
2. Status post cholecystectomy
3. Neuropathy secondary to chemotherapy
4. Status post left hip fracture [**7-/3382**]
 
Social History:
The patient is married and lives at home with his wife in 
[**Name2 (NI) 5476**]. He has three children, none of whom live at home. His 
wife has Alzheimer's dementia and receives a lot of care from 
her children. The patient's daughter died at age 20 from 
lymphoma (He thinks ALL).  He previously worked for NSTAR 
switching lines.  He denies any tobacco or drug use.  He reports 
occasional alchohol with about 1 beer per week. 

 
Family History:
His daughter died at age 20 of lymphoma (he believes ALL). He 
has an Aunt with melanoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year-old male with recurrent follicular cell lymphoma with 
recent chemotherapy and radiation to L3 who was admitted for 
pneumonia and sepsis.
.
1. Pneumonia: On chest x-ray, he had evidence of pneumonia.  
Given that he has recently been hospitalized, he was initially 
covered for both pseudomonas and MRSA with ceftazidime and 
vancomycin.  On hospital day 3, his oxygen requirement increased 
and he spiked a temperature; therefore, his antibiotic coverage 
was broadened to include Flagyl, Caspofungin, and Bactrim.  He 
improved on that regimen and his oxygen requirement decreased.  
An induced sputum showed budding yeast and was negative for PCP. 
 [**Name10 (NameIs) **] that time, the Flagyl and the treatment dose Bactrim was 
stopped.  His oxygen requirement decreased throughout his 
hospital course.  On discharge, he had completed 11 days of 
vancomycin and ceftazidime and 9 days of caspofungin.  He was 
discharged to complete 14 days of antibiotics with levofloxacin.
.
2. Sepsis: The source of his sepsis was likely the pneumonia.  
He was adequately volume resuscitated in the emergency 
department.  He was initially monitored in the intensive care 
unit.  His lactate trended down with fluids and he remained 
normotensive.
.
3. Lymphoma: He recently underwent a cycle of EPOCH chemotherapy 
2 weeks prior to admission.  He has just completed a 10-day 
course of radiation therapy for his L3 thecal sac compression.  
He was admitted on a prednisone taper from his recent admission. 
 When he was tapered from 40 to 20 mg of prednisone, he had 
increased pain and lower extremity weakness.  Until a cervical, 
thoracic, and lumbar spine MRI was negative for compression, he 
was maintained on high dose dexamethasone.  He was then maintain 
on 40 mg prednisone daily.  He also has C-3 disease for which he 
should continue to wear his soft c-spine collar.   During this 
admission, he had an increase in size of his right neck mass.  
He will need his third cycle of EPOCH chemotherapy once he has 
recovered from his pneumonia.  He was maintain on his 
allopurinol and prophylactic Bactrim.  
.
4. Anion gap acidosis: He initially had an anion gap acidosis 
that was likely secondary to lactate.  His anion gap acidosis 
resolved with fluid resuscitation.
.
5. Acute renal failure: On admission, his BUN and creatinine 
were elevated.  This was attributed to a pre-renal etiology in 
the setting of decreased perfusion from sepsis.  His creatinine 
returned to baseline with fluid resuscitation.   
.
6. Anemia: On admission, his hematocrit was near baseline of 
27-30.  His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic 
disease and his B12 and folate were normal.  His hematocrit 
dropped to 18 on hospital day 1, which was likely secondary to 
dilution from fluid resuscitation.  He received 1 U packed red 
cell transfusion with an appropriate increase in his hematocrit. 
 He hematocrit remained stable above 25 throughout the remainder 
of the admission.   
.
7. Hyperglycemia: He has no history of diabetes.  His elevated 
glucose was likely secondary to steroids.  He was covered with 
an insulin sliding scale.
.
8. FEN: He was maintained on a regular diet.  Initially, he 
received IV fluid resuscitation for low blood pressure as above. 
 His electrolytes were repleted.
.
9. Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI, bowel regimen.
.
10. Access: Left Port-a-cath and peripheral IV.  
.
11. Code: DNR/DNI
.
12. Dispo: He was discharged to rehab once his respiratory 
status had improved.  He will follow-up with his oncologist to 
discuss when to start cycle 3 of EPOCH.
