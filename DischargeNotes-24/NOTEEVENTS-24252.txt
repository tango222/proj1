                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     INDICATIONS:  Questionable intracranial hemorrhage seen at outside hospital.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISON:  Noncontrast CT scans from an outside hospital, which is not
     labeled on the films, which were acquired on [**2607-7-14**] at 5:35 PM.
     
     NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  There are multiple bilateral, remote hemispheric
     infarcts bilaterally, mostly in an MCA distribution, but also involving the
     brain stem.  There is expansion of the maxillary sinuses and flat bones of the
     calvarium, consistent with chronic organic brain disease/mental retardation.
     
     Within the right basal ganglia and in the subinsular white matter and
     periventricular white matter adjacent to the atrium of the right lateral
     ventricle is an amorphous area of increased attenuation which is somewhat
     linear.  This has the appearance of calcification, but acute blood products
     cannot be excluded.  This region is certainly no larger than on the outside
     hospital images, and the fact that it is not a well defined collection argues
     against an acute parenchymal hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally
     midline structures or hydrocephalus. No skull fractures are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Amorphous area of increased attenuation in the right basal
     ganglia/subinsular white matter/periventricular white matter near the atrium
     of the right lateral ventricle.  This has the appearance of calcification, but
     blood products cannot be excluded.  The area has not increased in size since
     the head CT scan from eight hours earlier.
     2.  Multiple bilateral hemispheric infarcts, and likely pontine infarct as
     well.
     3.  Decreased size of brain with expansion of maxillary sinuses and inner
     table, consistent with the patient's chronic mental retardation.
     
                                                                 (Over)

treated with ceftriaxone and Unasyn. Patient was sent to rehab 
after a brief hospitalization and then from rehab to home. 
Patient had increased secretions from 5 days PTA. From the 
morning of 07/27, patient had increased lethargy and had fevers 
to 102. Seen at [**Hospital 2811**] Hospital where there was concern for 
stroke; she was noted also to have guaic positive drainage from 
J-tube site. CT raised the concern of possible stroke with new 
bleed in the R external capsule. INR measured there was 3.9, as 
patient had been on coumadin since stroke in [**2604**]. Patient was 
transferred here because of concern for intracranial hemorrhage.
  
There is also a history of a bloody stool; it is unclear when 
that bloody stool happened. Patient's mother reports dark 
discharge from the J-tube.  

ER Course: Patient had leukocytosis to 51.7 with 81% 
neutrophils, 1% bands. Repeat head CT shows R basal ganglia 
calcification, however bleed could not be excluded; size has not

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2607-7-14**]:  Low lung volumes, no radiographic evidence of 
pneumonia.

CT head w/o contrast [**2607-7-14**]:  1) Amorphous area of increased 
attenuation in the right basal ganglia/subinsular white 
matter/periventricular white matter near the atrium of the right 
lateral ventricle.  This has the appearance of calcification, 
but blood products cannot be excluded.  The area has not 
increased in size since the head CT scan from eight hours 
earlier. 2) Multiple bilateral hemispheric infarcts and likely 
pontine infarct as well.  3)  Decreased size of brain, with 
expansion of maxillary sinuses and inner table, consistent with 
the patient's chronic mental retardation.

MR head w/o contrast [**2607-7-15**]:  1) No evidence of acute 
infarction, although diffusion-weighted imagining would be more 
sensitive for acute infarction. 2) Evidence of multiple past 
infarcts, including evidence of past hemorrhage in the right 
putamen and in a small region of the right parietal lobe.

CT head w/o contrast [**2607-7-15**]:  1) Stable appearance of the brain 
with no interval change noted since the previous exam.  Multiple 
old hemispheric infarcts noted.  Diffusion-weighted images are 
more sensitive to detect acute infarct. 2) A small area of 
increased attenuation in the right basal ganglia is suggestive 
of amorphous calcificatinos rather than blood by-products.  A 
followup scan might be helpful based on clinical findings. 

CXR [**2607-7-16**]:  Interval development of bibasilar patchy 
opacities, which may represent aspiration.

MRA brain w/o contrast [**2607-7-17**]:  1)  No significant interval 
change in the brain MR.  On this study, however, diffusion 
weighted images were performed, and these showed no evidence of 
acute infarction.  There is evidence of a chronic resolved slit 
hemorrhage in the right putamen, likely related to previous 
ischemic infarction.  There are widespread areas of chronic 
infarction in the subcortical white matter.  2)  The MRA shows 
absent flow signals in multiple major arteries of the circle of 
[**Location (un) **] with evidence of extensive formation of collaterals. This 
appearance is consistent with Moyamoya syndrome related to 
chronic occlusions among the major cerebral arteries.  

CXR [**2607-7-18**]:  1) Since the previous study there has been some 
improvement in the degree of right lower lobe partial 
atelectasis.  2) Areas of patchy infiltration in the right upper 
lobe and left upper lobe and left lower lobe are unchanged.  3) 
The tip of the SVP line remains in the right atrium.

CT head w/o contrast [**2607-7-18**]:  1) No new intracranial 
hemorrhage.  Appearance of brain unchanged since [**2607-6-15**].

CT abd/pelvis w contrast [**2607-7-18**]:  1)  Bilateral lower lobe 
patchy consolidations consistent with patient's known chronic 
aspiration.  2) No evidence of acute intraabdominal abnormality. 
 Multiple small mesenteric lymph[**MD Number 298**] are present which do not 
meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement.  Spleen small and 
dense, likely reflecting calcification.

Video oropharyngeal swallow study [**2607-7-20**]:  Penetration and 
aspiration with nectar thick and thin liquids secondary to poor 
bolus control and premature spillover.  Aspiration was silent, 
and cued coughs were inefective for clearing the airway of 
barium.  She showed evidence of phonatory apraxia in her delayed 
and discoordinated cued coughs.  Pureed and honey think liquids 
(by tsp) were not penetrated or aspirated during this study 
today.  1) Maintain PEG for primary source of nutrition, 
hydration, meds.  2) Pureed foods and honey thick liquids by 
teaspoon for pleasure may be allowed.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:  While in the MICU, the patient was seen by 
neurology and neurosurgery to further evaluate the possibility 
of a new intracranial hemorrhage.  In light of this, coumadin 
was discontinued, pending the results of the workup.  The 
patient had multiple head CTs, described in pertinent results 
section.  The conclusion from the scans was that Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1149**] did 
not have any new CVA, ischemic or hemorrhagic.  Of note, the 
findings raised a suggestion of Moyamoya disease.  Also while in 
the MICU, the patient was found to have one blood culture bottle 
positive for enterococcus that was ampicillin sensitive.  The 
change in mental status and elevated wbc count and temperature 
on admission were thought to be secondary to chronic aspiration, 
as a CXR on [**7-16**] revealed bilateral opacities consistent with 
aspiration pneumonia.  

Also while in the MICU the patient was seen by gastroenterology 
to investigate the guaiac positive drainage noted from the 
J-tube site while the patient was at [**Hospital 2811**] hospital, and the 
report of one episode of bloody stool, as per the mother.  They 
did not feel that the patient was having a GI bleed, as the 
patient's hematocrit remained stable, and there was noted to be 
no melanotic drainage from J-tube since arrival in our hospital, 
nor hematochezia.  Stool was found to be negative for 
salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, C.Difficile.  We followed 
with serial hematocrits, which have been stable between 19 and 
22 (unclear baseline), with no further melena/hematochezia 
noted.      

The patient was transferred from the MICU to the general floors 
on [**2607-7-16**].

While on the floors, we addressed the patient's numerous 
problems, with the common difficulty being uncertainty regarding 
the rational for medical decisions made for her in the past.

1)  Infectious disease:  We continued to treat the patient for 
her presumed aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone and flagyl.  
A TTE was performed to rule out endocarditis in light of the 
enterococcus cultured from her blood, which was negative.  At 
this time, on [**2607-7-20**], flagyl was discontinued and a two week 
course of IV ampicillin for treatment of the positive 
enterococcal blood culture was begun. At the time of this 
discharge summary ([**2607-7-24**]), the patient is on day [**5-1**] of 
ampicillin, and has completed a 10 day course of ceftriaxone.    
 

2)  Neuro:  An extensive effort was made at obtaining CT scan 
reports from the patient's 2002 stroke, which the mother says 
was managed at MCO (Medical College of [**State 4973**]), phone number 
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4974**], however they claim that the patient was not there 
in [**2604**].  After a review of all CT/MRI reports from our 
hospital, and a thorough investigation of the issue, we have 
decided to stop this patient's coumadin treatment.  The 
rationale behind this is many-fold.  First, we have to assume 
that the coumadin was initially begun due to concern for strokes 
that were embolic in nature.  However, patients with sickle cell 
disease are known to develop ischemic strokes, and coumadin has 
no demonstrated efficacy in these patients (see review in the 
American Journal of Medicine, [**2606-12-1**]).  
Additionally, there is still some uncertaintly as to whether or 
not the patient has had a hemorrhagic stroke in the past, as the 
MRI of 7/28 revealed evidence of past hemorrhage, in which case 
coumadin would most definitely be contraindicated.  
Additionally, the finding of changes characteristic of Moyamoya 
syndrome on MRI also preclude the use of coumadin, as these 
patients are prone to ischemic strokes as children, followed by 
hemorrhagic strokes as adults due to the fragility of the 
collateral vessles that develop in response to the stenotic 
vessels of the Circle of [**Location (un) 337**].  For all of these reasons, we 
believe that holding coumadin is the most rational approach to 
the management of this patient's unfortunate neurologic status.  


The patient also has a history of seizures, and was maintained 
on Oxcarbazepine 300 mg PO BID without any seizure activity.  

3)  Heme:  The patient continued to have a chronically low 
hematocrit, which fluctuated between 19 and 22 without receiving 
any transfusions.  We obtained iron studies, which demonstrated 
iron overload, which was expected in this patient who has been 
transfusion dependent, as per mother, and was on deferoxamine 
therapy 12 mL IV before admission to our hospital.  We restarted 
her deferoxamin at 1g IM per day, however the patient should be 
switched to IV so that she doesn't have to get painful IM shots 
everyday in the future.  Her reticulocyte count was 10.4, which 
indicates appropriate marrow response to her severe anemia.  A 
B12 level was within normal limits.  We started the patient on 
Folic Acid 3 mg per day, which should be continued in this 
patient with chronic hemolysis from sickle cell disease.  

Additionally, her peripheral smear persistently demonstrates not 
only sickled cells but also target cells, which is not typical 
of SSD, therefore a hemoglobin electrophoresis was ordered, and 
the patient was seen by hematology.  She will follow up with Dr. 
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with whom she has an appointment on [**2607-9-1**] 
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4975**]).  

[**Known patient firstname 4976**] should be on iron chelators chronically however it would 
be safe for her not to be on chelators for a few weeks while at 
rehab.  This would only be acceptable for 2-3 weeks at most.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1149**] also appears to have a chronic leukocytosis, usually in 
the 20,000 range.  She is currently at her baseline after being 
as high as 50,000 on admission.  

4)  GI: The patient has had a G and a J tube for unknown 
duration, with multiple adjustments and replacements.  There was 
noted to be scant purulent drainage around both tubes, which 
surgery evaluated.  As per the mother, there is always some 
drainage around the tubes, however it was noted to have 
increased.  Surgery felt that the drainage was simply the tube 
feeds, as the areas were not noted to be erythematous, 
indurated, or tender.  A would culture from [**7-15**] revealed sparse 
growth of MRSA, which was presumed to be colonization rather 
than infection in this chronically ill and hospitalized patient, 
without obvious signs of infection around the tube site.  

The question of the rationale behind the coexistance of a G-tube 
and a J-tube was discussed.  We do not have any records, however 
it was assumed that the G-tube may have been placed in order to 
decompress the stomach and prevent aspiration if gastroparesis 
was present.  The patient was also on Reglan, assumedly for the 
same rationale.  The G-tube has not been used while in our 
hospital, as the J-tube is used for the tube feeds, therefore it 
is unclear whether or not the patient really needs this 
additional tube.  We are keeping it capped for now, not on 
continuous suction, and flushing it periodically to maintain 
patency.  This tube should be kept in and flushed periodically 
for now, but if there continues to be no use for the tube, Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (her new PCP) will consider having the tube removed. 
Additionally, the patient has not received Reglan for the 3 days 
prior to discharge, without any problems, therefore we will 
leave this medication on a PRN basis, and it may be safe to 
completely discontinue if there continues to be no need. 

There continued to be no evidence of GI bleed for the remainder 
of the [**Hospital 874**] hospital course.  GI recommended that if there 
is ever again any suspicion, the patient can at that time have 
an EGD.  

5) FEN - The patient had a video swallow study in light of the 
suspicion of chronic aspiration, which is detailed in the 
pertinent results section.  The outcome of this was that the 
patient may try pureed and honey thick foods for pleasure, still 
maintaining tube feeds as her primary source of nutrition - 
Probalance Full strength at 55 mL/hour.  The patient aspirated 
with non-thickened fluids.  For now, the patient has been taking 
pureed and honey-thick foods, however if the patient continues 
to develop aspiration pneumonias, these may have to be 
discontinued.  The patient's aspiration, however, is most likely 
gastric contents rather than food.

6) Chronic Pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and 
came in on a Fentanyl patch, which was continued while in house. 
 In the future it would be useful to clarify the necessity of 
maintaining this.  In light of the chronic opiate use and 
immobility, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1149**] was given a bowel regimen while here, which 
should be continued.

7) Psych: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1149**] was on Lexapro 20 mg PO qd on admission, and 
was maintained on this.  However, the mother reports that the 
patient has continued to have depressed mood and lack of 
motivation, with behavior indicating hopelessness since her 
stroke in [**2604**], and therefore psychiatry was consulted regarding 
the appropriate medication choice.  In patients with multiple 
medical problems and a clear organic basis for depression, 
Ritalin can be helpful, and this should be considered in the 
future.  

8) Lines: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1149**] has had a portacath for 4 years, as per 
admission note.  For now this should be left in as she is on IV 
abx and with chronic aspiration is likely to need IV abx in the 
future, in addition to multiple other IV medications.  Also see 
discussion of G and J tubes above.  

9) Prophylaxis: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1149**] was given Lansoprazole Oral Suspension 
30 mg NG QD while here, which does not need to be continued as 
there is no clear indication (no high dose steroids, respirator, 
sepsis, etc.) for a PPI.  However, if the G-tube were ever to 
resume function this might be a good addition, as it could help 
prevent the development of alkalosis (would be removing a less 
acidic fluid from the stomach). 

She was started on prophylactic lovenox 40 mg SQ per day on the 
day of discharge, as she is largely immobile with multiple 
medical problems.  

10) PT/OT - [**Known patient firstname 4976**] was seen by PT and OT on [**2607-7-23**], who both 
felt that the patient could benefit from continued therapy.  PT 
felt the patient has good potential to improve her functioning, 
and felt she would benefit from a rehab facility to include [**2-20**] 
hours of combined therapy per day.  OT also felt that [**Known patient firstname 4976**] 
has good potential for progress given cognitive status, 
willingness to work with therapy, and AROM of all 4 extremities, 
and recommended d/c to acute rehab facility with goal of 
eventually returning home with family once functional status is 
maximized.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  CVA and right-sided internal capsular hemorrhage.
     
     Multiple axial images are obtained from the base to vertex without intravenous
     contrast administration.  Comparison is made to the prior head CT from [**7-14**], 2004.
     
     There is a small area of increased attenuation involving the right basal
     ganglia near the atrium of the right lateral ventricle.  The appearance is
     suggestive of calcification, however, blood products cannot be totally
     excluded.  There are multiple bilateral hemispheric infarcts, unchanged from
     the previous exam.  There is no midline shift or mass effect.  No
     hydrocephalus is noted.
     
     Overall size of the brain is diminished, most likely related to the patient's
     mental retardation.  There is thickening of the calvarium.  No subdural
     hemorrhage is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the brain with no interval change noted
     since the previous exam.  Multiple old hemispheric infarcts noted.  Diffusion-
     weighted images are more sensitive to detect acute infarct.
     
     A small area of increased attenuation in the right basal ganglia is suggestive
     of amorphous calcifications rather than blood by-products.  A followup scan
     might be helpful based on clinical findings.

     INDICATIONS: 25-year-old woman with sickle cell anemia and multiple strokes
     presenting with acute mental status changes. Evaluation for acute pathology.
     
     COMPARISONS: Noncontrast head CT of [**2607-7-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2, and susceptibility images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS: The study is limited by patient motion, and diffusion-weighted
     images were not obtained. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus, mass effect,
     or shift of the normally midline structures. There are widespread areas of
     increased T2 signal which indicate multiple previous deep and subcortical
     white matter infarctions, accompanied by broadening of the sulci.
     Susceptibility artifact in the right putamen and a similar small focus in the
     right parietal lobe suggest past hemorrhages in these areas. There is no
     evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction, although diffusion-
     weighted imaging would be more sensitive for acute infarct. The surrounding
     osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. The major vascular flow
     voids appear patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No evidence of acute infarction, although diffusion-weighted imaging would
     be more sensitive for acute infarction.
     2. Evidence of multiple past infarcts, including evidence of past hemorrhage
     in the right putamen and in a small region of the right parietal lobe. We
     discussed the findings with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1013**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1014**] at 2:30 PM on [**7-15**].

     INDICATIONS:  25 year-old woman with sickle cell anemia and history of
     repeated strokes, presenting with acute mental status changes.  There is a
     concern for a right internal capsular hemorrage, and request for follow up
     assessment.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Brain MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1019**] head CT of [**2607-7-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, susceptibility, and diffusion weighted images
     of the brain were obtained.
     
     An MR angiogram with 3 dimensional time-of-flight images of the circle of
     [**Location (un) 309**] was also obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  On the MR study of the brain, there has been no significant
     interval change.  The quality of this study is improved.  There is no evidence
     of hydrocephalus, mass effect, or shift of the normally midline structures.
     The previously seen susceptibility artifacts are again seen.  The larger one
     in the right putamen, which is associated with a linear area of
     encephalomalacia and a neighboring calcification, better seen on the CT scan,
     likely corresponds to an old slit hemorrhage.  There are no areas of
     restricted diffusion to suggest an acute infarct.  However, there is wide
     spread atrophy of the sulci with diffuse areas of increased T2 in the deep and
     subcortical white matter, suggesting chronic infarcts.  The surrounding
     osseous structure, soft tissues, and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     On the MR angiogram, the flow signal of the M1 segment of the right middle
     cerebral artery is absent.  There is also a segment of strongly reduced flow
     signal in the proximal left middle cerebral artery. No flow signals are seen
     from the anterior cerebral arteries. Flow signal of the left posterior
     cerebral artery is strongly reduced, and the size of the right posterior
     cerebral artery is enlarged. There is widespread enlargement of the smaller
     perforating arteries suggesting extensive collateral circulation. This
     appearance is consistent with Moyamoya syndrome related to chronic occlusions
     among of the major cerebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1.  There has been no significant interval change in the brain
     MR.  On this study, however, diffusion weighted images were performed, and
     these showed no evidence of acute infarction.  There is evidence of a chronic
     resolved slit hemorrhage in the right putamen, likely related to previous
     ischemic infarction.  There are widespread areas of chronic infarction in the
     subcortical white matter, as previously discussed.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  25 year-old woman with sickle cell anemia and history of
     repeated strokes, presenting with acute mental status changes.  There is a
     concern for a right internal capsular hemorrage, and request for follow up
     assessment.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Brain MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1019**] head CT of [**2607-7-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, susceptibility, and diffusion weighted images
     of the brain were obtained.
     
     An MR angiogram with 3 dimensional time-of-flight images of the circle of
     [**Location (un) 309**] was also obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  On the MR study of the brain, there has been no significant
     interval change.  The quality of this study is improved.  There is no evidence
     of hydrocephalus, mass effect, or shift of the normally midline structures.
     The previously seen susceptibility artifacts are again seen.  The larger one
     in the right putamen, which is associated with a linear area of
     encephalomalacia and a neighboring calcification, better seen on the CT scan,
     likely corresponds to an old slit hemorrhage.  There are no areas of
     restricted diffusion to suggest an acute infarct.  However, there is wide
     spread atrophy of the sulci with diffuse areas of increased T2 in the deep and
     subcortical white matter, suggesting chronic infarcts.  The surrounding
     osseous structure, soft tissues, and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     On the MR angiogram, the flow signal of the M1 segment of the right middle
     cerebral artery is absent.  There is also a segment of strongly reduced flow
     signal in the proximal left middle cerebral artery. No flow signals are seen
     from the anterior cerebral arteries. Flow signal of the left posterior
     cerebral artery is strongly reduced, and the size of the right posterior
     cerebral artery is enlarged. There is widespread enlargement of the smaller
     perforating arteries suggesting extensive collateral circulation. This
     appearance is consistent with Moyamoya syndrome related to chronic occlusions
     among of the major cerebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1.  There has been no significant interval change in the brain
     MR.  On this study, however, diffusion weighted images were performed, and
     these showed no evidence of acute infarction.  There is evidence of a chronic
     resolved slit hemorrhage in the right putamen, likely related to previous
     ischemic infarction.  There are widespread areas of chronic infarction in the
     subcortical white matter, as previously discussed.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  25 year old with sickle cell anemia, parenchymal hemorrhage and
     fever.  Question of increasing infiltrate.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous study dated two days earlier and
     shows the left subclavian line with tip in the right atrium.  Poor inspiratory
     effort and elevation of the diaphragms.  Some partial atelectasis is involving
     the right lower lobe.  In addition, there are areas of patchy infiltration in
     the left upper lobe, left lower lobe and right upper lobe.the  degree of right
     lower lobe partial atelectasis has improved since the prior study and the
     right hemidiaphragm is again visualized.  No evidence of pleural effusion or
     pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Since the previous study, there has been some improvement in the degree of
     right lower lobe partial atelectasis.
     
     2.  Areas of patchy infiltration in the right upper lobe and left upper lobe
     and left lower lobe are unchanged.
     
     3.  The tip of the SVP line remains in the right atrium.

     INDICATION: Chronic aspiration pneumonia, sickle cell disease, enterococcus
     positive blood cultures, evaluate for source.  Patient also with hematocrit
     drop.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were aquired helically
     following the administration of oral and 100 cc of Optiray IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON: None.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are patchy areas of ground glass opacity in
     both lung bases, with several areas of air bronchograms.  The findings are
     consistent with the patient's known chronic aspiration.  Evaluation of the
     upper abdomen is limited due to  the patient's arm position, as the arms are
     not able to be placed above the head.  Allowing for the limitations, the liver
     is unremarkable.  The spleen is small and dense, likely reflecting
     calficication. Both kidneys enhance without evidence of obstruction. It is
     difficult to evaluate for the presence of striated nephrogram due to extensive
     beam hardening artifact from the patient's arms. Surgical clips are present in
     the right upper quadrant from prior cholecystectomy.  The pancreas, stomach,
     and small bowel loops are all unremarkable.  A J-tube is present within small
     bowel. There is no ascites. Note is made of multiple small mesenteric lymph
     nodes which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The appendix is visualized, and is normal, filled
     with oral contrast.  The bladder contains a Foley catheter but is otherwise
     unremarkable.  Sigmoid colon and rectum are normal.  There is no free fluid in
     the pelvis.  The CT appearance of the female reproductive structures is within
     normal limits.
     
     There is no retroperitoneal hematoma or evidence of fluid collection.  Osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
