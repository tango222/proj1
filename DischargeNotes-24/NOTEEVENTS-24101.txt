LEFT FOOT, TWO VIEWS [**2674-3-17**]
There is a large skin defect overlying the posteroinferior 
calcaneus. However, the calcaneus is within normal limits, 
without evidence of osteomyelitis. A small inferior calcaneal 
spur is noted. Probable diffuse osteopenia, but no focal bone 
destruction.

ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) RIGHT  [**2674-3-17**] 
Considerable periosteal new bone formation along the mid and 
distal fibula and tibia, with some surrounding soft tissue 
edema. Differential diagnosis includes reactive changes, 
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, and osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis 
is considered somewhat less likely given the diffuse nature of 
the abnormality, but should be correlated with clinical 
findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the SICU on [**3-16**] after transfer from 
OSH for rapidly worsening infection of LLE.  He was started on 
broad spectrum triple antibiotic therapy and maintained on the 
ventilator.  His vent was able to be weaned and he was extubated 
on [**3-17**].  Plastic surgery and podiatric surgery were consulted 
for further management of extensive wounds.  His antibiotics 
were narrowed on [**3-20**] to clindamycin and oxacillin for outside 
hospital culture data showing staph aureus (MSSA). Incision and 
wash-out of left lower extremity was performed on [**3-21**].  A 
tissue biopsy was sent to pathology and for culture at that 
time.  Culture results were positive for stenotrophomonas 
maltophilia sensitive to bactrim.  This [**Doctor Last Name 978**] was added to his 
antibiotic regimen on [**3-27**].  A vac was placed on [**3-24**] and 
continued with changes every 2-3days.

On [**3-30**] plastic surgery performed a split thickness skin graft 
from left and right thigh to the LLE.  A vac dressing was in 
place for 5 days post-op.  On POD5 the vac was taken down and 
the graft noted to have taken well with good granulation.  Twice 
daily dressing changes were performed with iodoform covering new 
graft, then kerlex wrapping, then an ACE bandage wrapped.  The 
donor sites also had iodoform but these sites were left open to 
air and the edges have been trimmed as they loosen.  Please do 
not remove iodoform from thighs but continue to trim edges as 
they curl away from skin.

Patient also has an area of superficial denuded tissue at right 
upper gluteal approx 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm with yellow base.  Wound 
care followed the patient and recommended turning side to side q 
1-2 hours; BID & prn bowel movement cleanse pt gluteals with 
foam cleanser and pat dry applying double guard ointment then 
aloe vesta barrier cream.

     AP CHEST, 5:37 A.M., [**3-16**].
     
     HISTORY:  Left lower extremity infection.  Intubated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
     
     There is heterogeneous opacification in a partially atelectatic right upper
     lobe, which may contain a discrete 24 mm right suprahilar nodule.  Both hila
     are enlarged and the upper mediastinum is widened.  In the absence of prior
     films, we cannot assess the chronicity of these findings, which should be
     considered central adenopathy, right upper lobe nodule and atelectasis, until
     proved otherwise.
     
     Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion.  ET
     tube tip is at the thoracic inlet, and a nasogastric tube can be traced only
     as far as the mid esophagus, due in part to the large size of this patient.
     
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8866**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9954**] and I discussed these findings at the time of dictation.

     RIGHT ANKLE, THREE VIEWS: No previous films on pacs record for comparison.
     
     There is mild soft tissue edema about the ankle.  There is periosteal new bone

     Portable AP chest film was done and compared to the previous AP chest film
     from yesterday [**2674-3-16**].
     
     Marked improvement of the heterogeneous opacifications in partly atelectatic
     right upper lobe is seen with small residual opacification seen near the minor
     fissure.  There is also improvement in the left upper lobe opacification with
     almost complete clearing of it.  The tip of endotracheal tube is in a good
     position.  The end of the NG tube project over the left upper abdomen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of the right upper lobe and left upper lobe
     atelectasis, with residual upper lobe opacities. Upright PA and lateral chest
     films are recommended for the evaluation of the residual changes in the upper
     lobes when the patient's condition permits.

     INDICATION:  Necrotizing fasciitis requiring double lumen PICC line.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2253**] [**Name (STitle) 188**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 188**] d'Othee, the Attending Radiologist, being present and supervising
     throughout. The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion. Since no suitable superficial vein was visible, ultrasound
     was used to identify an appropriate right basilic vein.  Hardcopy ultrasound
     images were obtained to confirm patency.  The right basilic vein was accessed
     via a 21- gauge micropuncture needle, and under ultrasound guidance, 0.018
     guide wire was advanced to the level of the atriocaval junction.  Over the
     introducer sheath, the PICC line, trimmed to 39 cm, with advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance with its tip placed at the atriocaval junction.  The
     PICC was statlocked, heplocked, and flushed.  It was secured to the skin by a
     sterile dressing. The line is ready for use.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of double lumen, 39 cm, PICC via the right
     basilic vein with its tip at the atriocaval junction; line is ready for use.
