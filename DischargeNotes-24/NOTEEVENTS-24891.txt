     HISTORY:  Fall and facial trauma, question pneumothorax.
     
     TRAUMA SERIES:
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position
     approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  Heart size is at the upper limits of
     normal.  Prominence of upper zone vessels likely relates to low inspiratory
     volumes.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left base and equivocal slight
     blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  Doubt focal infiltrate or gross
     effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No suspicious widening of the
     mediastinum or apical capping is detected.  Probable calcified granuloma (6.5
     mm) overlying the left rib.  No displaced rib fracture is identified on these
     lung technique films.  Osteopenia and degenerative changes of the thoracic
     spine are noted.
     
     PELVIS, SINGLE AP VIEW:  The iliac crests are excluded from the film.  The
     right femoral neck is not optimally demonstrated due to internal rotation of
     the hip.  There are mild to moderate degenerative changes of both hips.  No
     displaced fracture is detected on this single view.  SI joints and pubic
     symphysis are within normal limits for age.

     INDICATION: History of trauma, evalaute for bleed.
     
     COMPARISONS: None.
     
     TECHNIQUE: MDCT-aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     obtained.
     
     CONTRAST: Oral contrast and 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast was administered due
     to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Areas of consolidation are noted
     bilaterally at the lung bases, which may represent atelectasis or aspiration.
     No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are identified. No pneumothorax is
     seen.
     
     Several hypodense lesions are seen in the liver, the largest of which is in
     the right lobe of the liver measuring 21 mm in its largest diameter, likely
     representing hepatic cysts. There is no evidence of liver laceration. The
     spleen is normal in appearance, without any evidence of stomach laceration or
     hematoma. The pancreas, duodenum, kidneys, and adrenal glands are normal in
     appearance. There is no evidence of any hemorrhage in these organs. No free
     air or free fluid is identified within the abdomen. The bowel is normal in
     appearance without evidence of wall thickening. No retroperitoneal or
     mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen. Diastasis of the recti is noted. Also
     noted is a large paraesophageal hernia.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, bladder, and ureters are normal
     in appearance. Multiple diverticula are noted within the sigmoid colon without
     any evidence of active inflammation. There is no evidence of free fluid or
     free air within the pelvis. The bladder appears to be intact. No pelvic
     lymphadenopathy is seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No fractures are identified. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic
     lesions are seen.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in
     delineating the anatomy and pathology.

     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with fall and right facial laceration and right
     [**Hospital Unit Name **] muscle entrapment.  Please evaluate for facial and orbital fractures.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images through the sinuses were performed with coronal and
     sagittal reconstructions without contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  Several facial and sinus fractures are idnetified.  There is a
     fracture of the right orbital floor with a large defect through which there is
     herniation of the orbital fat into the right maxillary sinus.  There is loss
     of continuity of the body of the right inferior rectus muscle, which is
     worrisome for disruption or severence of this muscle, although it is not seen
     protruding through the orbital floor fracture defect.  Additionally, the right
     lateral orbital wall is also fractured.  Orbital emphysema is present. There
     are several nasal fractures, including the nasal septum and left lateral nasal
     wall.  Both the lateral and medial walls of the right maxillary sinus are
     fractured.  There is fracture of the right lateral pterygoid process.
     Additionally, the left nasal floor (hard palate) is fractured.
     
     There is fluid mixed with high-density material in both maxillary sinuses,
     right greater than left, likely hemorrhage.  Additionally, there is high-
     density material in the nasal cavity, also likely hemorrhage.
     
     There is diastasis of the right frontal-zygomatic suture.  No fracture of
     either zygomatic arch is identified.  There is no depression of the malar arch
     on the right or left.  The cribriform plate is intact.
     
     There is subcutaneous air in the right infratemporal fossa (masticator
     space).
     
     There is fullness and heterogeneity of the attenuation of the right optic
     nerve as it inserts into the globe, suspicious for a posterior hematoma within
     Tenon's capsule, being the fibrous capsule in which the globe is suspended.  
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Multiple facial fractures as described above, including the right orbital
     floor, with herniation of the orbital contents into the right maxillary sinus
     and disruption or severence of the inferior rectus muscle.
     
     2) Likely posterior orbital hematoma in Tenon's capsule.
     
     3) Lateral and medial right maxillary wall fractures with likely hemorrhage

     INDICATION: History of trauma, evalaute for bleed.
     
     COMPARISONS: None.
     
     TECHNIQUE: MDCT-aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     obtained.
     
     CONTRAST: Oral contrast and 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast was administered due
     to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Areas of consolidation are noted
     bilaterally at the lung bases, which may represent atelectasis or aspiration.
     No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are identified. No pneumothorax is
     seen.
     
     Several hypodense lesions are seen in the liver, the largest of which is in
     the right lobe of the liver measuring 21 mm in its largest diameter, likely
     representing hepatic cysts. There is no evidence of liver laceration. The
     spleen is normal in appearance, without any evidence of stomach laceration or
     hematoma. The pancreas, duodenum, kidneys, and adrenal glands are normal in
     appearance. There is no evidence of any hemorrhage in these organs. No free
     air or free fluid is identified within the abdomen. The bowel is normal in
     appearance without evidence of wall thickening. No retroperitoneal or
     mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen. Diastasis of the recti is noted. Also
     noted is a large paraesophageal hernia.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, bladder, and ureters are normal
     in appearance. Multiple diverticula are noted within the sigmoid colon without
     any evidence of active inflammation. There is no evidence of free fluid or
     free air within the pelvis. The bladder appears to be intact. No pelvic
     lymphadenopathy is seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No fractures are identified. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic
     lesions are seen.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in
     delineating the anatomy and pathology.

     INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman status post fall, assess for ligamentous injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained throughout the
     cervical spine. Axial images were obtained from the level of C2-C3 to the
     level of C7-T1.
     
     FINDINGS: No previous examination available for comparison.
     
     Mild prevertebral soft tissue swelling is visualized. Vertebral bodies are
     aligned, but there is widening of the intervertebral disc at the level of C6-
     C7. Increased T2 signal is seen at the C6-C7 intertebral disc, raising
     suspicion for traumatic injury. There is also soft tissue swelling seen in the
     posterior soft tissue in the upper cervical spine and also abnormal signal
     intensity at the interspinous ligament at the level of C6-C7. These findings,
     in conjunction with the history of trauma, are highly suspicious for
     ligamentous injury.
     
     No bony fractures are visualized. There is increase in the spinal lordosis.
     Degenerative changes are present throughout the cervical spine. There is
     calcification of the transverse ligament.
     
     IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of ligamentous injury at the level of C6-C7.
     No bony fractures are identified. No cord compression is seen.

     RIGHT SHOULDER, 2 PORTABLE VIEWS: As these are portable images with strong
     soft tissue attenuation, evaluation of bony detail is somewhat limited.
     However, there is no evidence of fracture. Osteophytes are seen surrounding
     the AC joint, which appears preserved. Although these views do not suggest
     dislocation, the possibility cannot be totally excluded on these 2 AP views.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture. If there is a clinical concern of
     possible dislocation, an additional axillary or Y view might be helpful in
     further evaluation. Degenerative changes of the AC joint.

REVIEW of SYSTEMS:

RESP....Trach collar since 1000 this am.  Relatively stable off vent.  Monitoring closely for tiring----??possible need to rest overnight.  Initially tachypneic when first taken off vent---up to 40's.  Settled with extra pain medicine and verbal reassurance.  Has had a RR teens to low 30's since.  O2 sats fluctuate depending upon which side pt is on.  L side down, sats 91-96%.  Any other way, adequate sats.  This is not a new [**Last Name 5188**] problem, even on vent.  See careview for several ABG trends throughout the day.  Suctioned frequently when initially off vent for thick, blood tinged secretions.  Much less now. Lung fields coarse to clear once suctioned.  

Neuro...Pain medicine changed to provide more adeuate long lasting pain relief.  Initially in shift when only on fentanyl---adequate relief, but brief. Whenever awake, c/o of lots of pain. Changed to dilaudid and fentanyl patch 25mcg added. After 1mg of didlaid at 1230, pt as slept well since.  Awakens to verbal stimuli, but then goes back to [**Doctor Last Name **].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Hypoxia CVL.
     
     Compared with one day earlier, new right subclavian CVL has been placed.  The
     tip overlies the distal SVC, near the RA junction.  No pneumothorax is
     detected.  There is an unusual linear lucency projecting over the left
     ventricle and left upper quadrant of the abdomen - this is not physiologic in
     appearance and may lie outside the patient.  Clinical correlation and
     attention to this area on  followup films is recommended.  Otherwise, no
     significant change is detected.

     FINDINGS:
     
     Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central venous catheter remain in
     stable position.  As before, there is cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural
     effusions, left greater than right.  In the interval, there is improved
     aeration at the right lower lobe, with decreased atelectasis.  There is a
     persistent left retrocardiac density, which could represent atelectasis. 
     Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, unchanged.
     2)  Improving right lower lobe atelectasis.
     3)  Left retrocardiac opacity, although this likely represents compressive
     atelectasis from the adjacent effusion, underlying pneumonia cannot be
     excluded.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman who is S/P an anterior spinal fusion
     now with persistent low grade fevers and elevated white count assess for
     epidural abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, axial T2 and gradient echo, and sagittal
     and axial T1 weighted images post-gadolinium contrast administration were
     obtained.  A comparison is made to a prior pre-operative cervical spine MRI
     dated [**3274-1-19**].
     
     FINDINGS:  This study is severely limited due to patient motion.  There is
     also a significant amount of magnetic susceptibility artifact from the
     anterior spinal fusion spanning from C5 to C7.  These images are non-
     diagnostic and we cannot exclude an epidural process such as an epidural
     abscess or enhancement in the marrow cavities. The alignment of the cervical
     vertebrae is within normal limits.  There is a prominent amount of pannus at
     the atlanto-axial joint which is consistent with degenerative change.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Severely limited evaluation of the cervical spine.  The images
     are non-diagnostic to assess for an epidural abscess or other infectious
     process involving the cervical spine.  IF there is concern of such
     processes, the study should be repeated. The alignment of the cervical
     vertebrae is unremarkable.
     
     This report was discussed in detail with the team taking care of the patient
     on [**3274-2-5**] at 4:50pm.

     Optiray contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  There is apparent perforation of the duodenum, with
     barium seen adjacent to the duodenum in the region of the C-loop, best seen on
     series 2, image 46.  There is a fair amount of fat stranding in this region.
     There is duodenal wall thickening.  Oral contrast is seen in the
     retroperitoneum, layering anteriorly against the right psoas muscle.  There is
     associated air bubbles and oral contrast seen posterior to the right crus of
     the diaphragm.  There is a fair amount of fat stranding in the right abdomen.
     
     There is a small right pleural effusion, with associated compressive
     atelectasis at the right base.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left base.
     No pericardial effusion.  There is a simple cyst in the posterior right liver.
     Otherwise the liver is unremarkable.  The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable.  There is a gastrostomy present
     with a tube in place.  There is atherosclerosis of the aorta.
     
     CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  The large bowel demonstrates numerous diverticula
     without evidence of diverticulitis.  There is a Foley catheter in the bladder.
     There is a small uterus present.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in
     the pelvis.

     INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant tenderness.  Severe diarrhea.  History of C-
     diff colitis.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with the 64-MDCT following the administration of oral and 150 cc of
     Optiray contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  There is apparent perforation of the duodenum, with
     barium seen adjacent to the duodenum in the region of the C-loop, best seen on
     series 2, image 46.  There is a fair amount of fat stranding in this region.
     There is duodenal wall thickening.  Oral contrast is seen in the
     retroperitoneum, layering anteriorly against the right psoas muscle.  There is
     associated air bubbles and oral contrast seen posterior to the right crus of
     the diaphragm.  There is a fair amount of fat stranding in the right abdomen.
     
     There is a small right pleural effusion, with associated compressive
     atelectasis at the right base.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left base.
     No pericardial effusion.  There is a simple cyst in the posterior right liver.
     Otherwise the liver is unremarkable.  The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable.  There is a gastrostomy present
     with a tube in place.  There is atherosclerosis of the aorta.
     
     CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  The large bowel demonstrates numerous diverticula
     without evidence of diverticulitis.  There is a Foley catheter in the bladder.
     There is a small uterus present.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in
     the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions
     identified.
     
     REFORMATTED IMAGES:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were essential in
     delineating the anatomy and pathology in this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Perforation of the duodenum with oral contrast and air within the
     retroperitoneum as described.  There is thickening of the duodenum, and a fair
     amount of stranding in the abdomen on the right.
                                                                 (Over)
