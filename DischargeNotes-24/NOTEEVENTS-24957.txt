Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the SICU for observation of his rectal 
bleeding.  His rectum was packed and his hcts remained stable.  
On HD2 his packing was removed and he was advanced to a liquid 
diet.  He showed some more bleeding from his rectum and serial 
hcts continued to be monitored, though they remained stable.  Pt 
was advanced to a regular diet on HD3, but continued to have 
periodic rectal bleeding.  He was demonstrated to be stable by 
serial hcts, and was discharged to rehab on HD4 with plans to 
begin to restart his coumadin and follow up at the end of the 
week with a hct to re-evaluate his hemodynamic status.

Discharge Instructions:
Go to an Emergency Room or call the office if [**Doctor First Name **] experience new 
and continuing nausea, vomiting, fevers (>101.5 F), abdominal 
pain, chills, or shortness of breath.  Also go to the ER if [**Doctor First Name **] 
notice an increase in the blood that [**Doctor First Name **] see coming from your 
rectum.

No heavy lifting or exertion for at least 6 weeks.

No driving while taking pain medications.

Narcotics can cause constipation.  Please take an over the

as Milk of Magnesia if [**Doctor First Name **] experience constipation.

[**Doctor First Name 27**] may resume your regular low fat diet as tolerated.

It is important to rebuild your strength.  Please work hard in

Please be sure to have your coagulation studies done at the end 
of the week ([**2739-4-7**]).  This will evaluate how well the coumadin 
is working.  Typically [**Doctor First Name **] take 4mg coumadin a night, but given 
your recent bleeding we are starting [**Doctor First Name **] back on only 2mg a 
night.  This may have to be adjusted by either your primary care 
doctor or your cardiologist.
 
Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in his office in two 
weeks.  His office number is: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 636**].

     The patient is status post three-component knee prosthesis in overall anatomic
     alignment.  No periprosthetic lucency to suggest loosening and no focal
     osteolysis is identified.  There is some soft tissue density over [**Last Name (un) 7893**] fat
     pad obscuring the interface with the patellar tendon as well as some soft
     tissue density along the expected course of the suprapatellar recess.  I doubt
     gross joint effusion.  Faint calcific flecks superimposed over [**Last Name (un) 7893**] fat pad
     and the patellar tendon are noted.  However, no donor site is suggested to
     confirm the presence of an avulsion.  Vascular calcification is present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No fracture or hardware loosening.

     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Known pelvic fracture.  Assess for acetabular fracture.
     
     Comparison is made to radiographs dated [**2739-10-29**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast CT through the pelvis with coronally and sagittally
     reformatted images.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  Again seen is a fracture through the lateral aspect of the
     iliac bone, extending to the anterior acetabulum.  Fracture lines extend into
     the acetabular roof, although no fracture fragment is seen within the hip
     joint space superiorly.  A tiny calcific [**Doctor Last Name 1741**] is seen within the inferior
     dependent aspect of the hip joint.  The femoral head, neck, and imaged
     portions of the proximal shaft appear unremarkable.  No left-sided pelvic
     fractures are seen.
     
     A hip joint effusion and a soft tissue hematoma surrounding the fracture is
     noted.  Additionally, there is a 1.8 cm abnormal appearing lymph node in the
     right groin.  Distal to this, some soft tissues stranding and other smaller
     lymph nodes with fatty hila are noted, possibly related to recent attempts at
     femoral vein puncture or arterial puncture.
     
     There are bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.  Imaged portions of the
     pelvic contents are grossly unremarkable within the limits of this unenhanced
     exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  Right iliac fracture extending into the anterior acetabulum and acetabular
     roof.  While no definite underlying lesion is evident on these images, the
     assessment is obscured by hematoma, and an underlying lesion cannot be
     entirely excluded.  Followup with MRI in 3 months is recommended.
     2.  Abnormal 18 mm lymph node in the right groin, for which correlation with
     physical examination is recommended.  Does this patient have a history of
     underlying malignancy?
     
     These findings, questions, and recommendations were discussed by telephone

      81 year old man with hx of pelvic fracture, has R calf tenderness               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  81-year-old man with history of pelvic fracture with right calf
     tenderness.  Evaluate for DVT.
     
     Both grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound examination was performed.  There
     is normal compressibility, respiratory variation in response to augmentation
     of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.  No
     intraluminal filling defects are present.  Evaluation of the greater saphenous
     vein is limited secondary to changes from the patient's prior surgery in this
     region.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No deep venous thrombosis.

     RIGHT HIP, TWO VIEWS.
     
     INDICATION:  Right hip fracture.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison to [**2739-10-28**].  Previously identified vertically oriented
     fracture of the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] extending into the right acetabular roof is
     again noted.  Alignment of the fracture is unchanged compared to the previous
     exam.  No significant healing has occurred compared to the previous study.  No
     significant degenerative changes are noted.  Trace vascular calcification is
     seen.  Evaluation of the sacrum is partially obscured by overlying bowel gas. 
     Soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable. There is mild degenerative change of
     the right hip.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Unchanged appearance of a vertically oriented right iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] fracture
     extending into the right acetabulum.

     INDICATION:  81-year-old man with hip pain, inability to bear weight after
     fall.  Pelvis fracture six weeks ago.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2739-11-30**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Two images of the pelvis demonstrate interval callus formation of
     the vertical oriented displaced right iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] fracture.  No other
     significant changes.  The sacrum is partially obscured by bowel gas.  Vascular
     calcifications are again noted.  Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine
     incompletely assessed on this pelvic radiograph.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval callus formation of the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] fracture.
