                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left MCA aneurysm.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.  Additionally, left posterior communicating
     artery aneurysm, left anterior choroidal artery aneurysm, right posterior
     communicating artery aneurysm and right ICA bifurcation aneurysm.
     
     INDICATIONS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1590**] is a 56 year old man who presented with 5 to 6 week
     history of a left eyelid ptosis and diplopia on visual field testing who is
     diagnosed by MRI and MRA with a left-sided MCA bifurcation aneurysm.  He
     undergoes a diagnostic cerebral angiogram to evaluate this further and to
     assess for a presence of other intracranial aneurysms.
     
     CONSENT:   The patient and his wife were given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure.  Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient and his wife understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right subclavian, right vertebral, right common carotid, right internal

     carotid, right external carotid, left common carotid, left internal carotid,
     left external carotid, left subclavian, left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates smooth runoff
     to the arm without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth of the
     right vertebral artery.  The right vertebral artery has a normal cervical
     intracranial course and attributes fluid to the basilar artery and its
     branches into the posterior communicating artery on the left as well as the
     bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.  There is no evidence of stenosis,
     dissection, or intracranial aneurysm.  Injection of the right common carotid
     artery demonstrates a smooth cervical course without evidence of stenosis or
     dissection and a smooth appearing right carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the
     right internal carotid artery demonstrates normal cervical, petrous, and
     intracranial course without evidence of stenosis, dissection or intracranial
     aneurysm. There is evidence of aneurysm located at the origin of the right
     posterior communicating artery measuring approximately 1 1/2 mm in diameter as
     well as the right internal carotid artery bifurcation measuring 1 to 1.5 mm in
     greatest diameter.  Otherwise there is normal contribution to the MCA and its
     branches and to the ACA.  There is no other evidence of intracranial aneurysm
     or stenosis as confirmed by the rotational three dimensional angiography.
     Injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates normal branching
     pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left common carotid artery demonstrates a
     normal cervical course without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth
     appearing left carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the left internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a multilobulated 3 x 6 mm aneurysm at the origin of the
     left posterior communicating artery with a 2 1/2 mm neck as well as a small 2
     to 3 mm aneurysm at the origin of the anterior choroidal artery. At the left
     MCA bifrucation, there is a 3 x 3 mm aneurysm of a 3 mm neck which is not
     amenable to coil embolization.  Otherwise there is no evidence of intracranial
     aneurysms visualized.  However, on the rotational three dimensional views, two
     small aneurysms protruding behind the identified wide neck MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm are seen.  There is no evidence of intracranial stenosis or
     dissection.  Injection of the left external carotid artery demonstrates normal
     branching pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates normal
     runoff to the arm.  No evidence of stenosis or dissection in a smooth
     appearing origin of the left vertebral artery. Injection of the left vertebral
     artery demonstrates a normal cervical and intracranial course without evidence
     of aneurysm, stenosis or dissection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple intracranial aneurysms as described above including a
     left posterior communicating artery, left anterior choroidal artery, left MCA
     bifurcation, right posterior communicating artery and right ICA bifurcation
     aneurysm not amenable to coil embolization.

     carotid, right external carotid, left common carotid, left internal carotid,
     left external carotid, left subclavian, left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates smooth runoff
     to the arm without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth of the
     right vertebral artery.  The right vertebral artery has a normal cervical
     intracranial course and attributes fluid to the basilar artery and its
     branches into the posterior communicating artery on the left as well as the
     bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.  There is no evidence of stenosis,
     dissection, or intracranial aneurysm.  Injection of the right common carotid
     artery demonstrates a smooth cervical course without evidence of stenosis or
     dissection and a smooth appearing right carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the
     right internal carotid artery demonstrates normal cervical, petrous, and
     intracranial course without evidence of stenosis, dissection or intracranial
     aneurysm. There is evidence of aneurysm located at the origin of the right
     posterior communicating artery measuring approximately 1 1/2 mm in diameter as
     well as the right internal carotid artery bifurcation measuring 1 to 1.5 mm in
     greatest diameter.  Otherwise there is normal contribution to the MCA and its
     branches and to the ACA.  There is no other evidence of intracranial aneurysm
     or stenosis as confirmed by the rotational three dimensional angiography.
     Injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates normal branching
     pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left common carotid artery demonstrates a
     normal cervical course without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth
     appearing left carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the left internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a multilobulated 3 x 6 mm aneurysm at the origin of the
     left posterior communicating artery with a 2 1/2 mm neck as well as a small 2
     to 3 mm aneurysm at the origin of the anterior choroidal artery. At the left
     MCA bifrucation, there is a 3 x 3 mm aneurysm of a 3 mm neck which is not
     amenable to coil embolization.  Otherwise there is no evidence of intracranial
     aneurysms visualized.  However, on the rotational three dimensional views, two
     small aneurysms protruding behind the identified wide neck MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm are seen.  There is no evidence of intracranial stenosis or
     dissection.  Injection of the left external carotid artery demonstrates normal
     branching pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates normal
     runoff to the arm.  No evidence of stenosis or dissection in a smooth
     appearing origin of the left vertebral artery. Injection of the left vertebral
     artery demonstrates a normal cervical and intracranial course without evidence
     of aneurysm, stenosis or dissection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple intracranial aneurysms as described above including a
     left posterior communicating artery, left anterior choroidal artery, left MCA
     bifurcation, right posterior communicating artery and right ICA bifurcation
     aneurysm not amenable to coil embolization.

     INDICATION:  Cranial nerve palsy on the left, evaluate for mass and vascular
     abnormality.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted imaging of the brain was performed.
     Diffusion weighted scans and post Gadolinium T1 weighted images are provided.
     
     3D TOF MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) **] was performed.  Multiplanar
     reformatted images and source image data are reviewed.
     
     No previous studies are available for comparison.
     
     
     No T1 or T2 signal abnormalities are identified within the brain parenchyma.
     There is no diffusion signal abnormality to indicate the presence of recent
     infarction.
     
     No masses or abnormal enhancement are detected within the brain or extra-axial
     spaces.  No abnormal enhancement is identified in the location of the root
     entry zone of the third cranial nerve or around the cavernous sinuses.
     
     There is mild widening of the superior basilar artery, at its bifurcation into
     the posterior cerebral arteries.  It cannot be determined if a small aneurysm
     is in this location.
     
     MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) **] demonstrates flow signal in both intracranial
     internal carotid arteries, anterior middle cerebral arteries.  There appears
     to be a small aneurysm arising from the bifurcation of the left middle
     cerebral bifurcation.  There is also indistinctness of the origins of the
     posterior cerebral arteries, limiting assessment of the basilar tip.  An
     aneurysm cannot be excluded in this location.
     
     Posterior inferior cerebellar arteries are not visualized.  The posterior
     communicating arteries are also not adequately seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No evidence of a stroke, mass or abnormal intracranial enhancement.
     There is some irregularity of the basilar tip and there is question of

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Cranial nerve palsy on the left, evaluate for mass and vascular
     abnormality.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted imaging of the brain was performed.
     Diffusion weighted scans and post Gadolinium T1 weighted images are provided.
     
     3D TOF MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) **] was performed.  Multiplanar
     reformatted images and source image data are reviewed.
     
     No previous studies are available for comparison.
     
     
     No T1 or T2 signal abnormalities are identified within the brain parenchyma.
     There is no diffusion signal abnormality to indicate the presence of recent
     infarction.
     
     No masses or abnormal enhancement are detected within the brain or extra-axial
     spaces.  No abnormal enhancement is identified in the location of the root
     entry zone of the third cranial nerve or around the cavernous sinuses.
     
     There is mild widening of the superior basilar artery, at its bifurcation into
     the posterior cerebral arteries.  It cannot be determined if a small aneurysm
     is in this location.
     
     MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) **] demonstrates flow signal in both intracranial
     internal carotid arteries, anterior middle cerebral arteries.  There appears
     to be a small aneurysm arising from the bifurcation of the left middle
     cerebral bifurcation.  There is also indistinctness of the origins of the
     posterior cerebral arteries, limiting assessment of the basilar tip.  An
     aneurysm cannot be excluded in this location.
     
     Posterior inferior cerebellar arteries are not visualized.  The posterior
     communicating arteries are also not adequately seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No evidence of a stroke, mass or abnormal intracranial enhancement.
     There is some irregularity of the basilar tip and there is question of
     aneurysm at the left middle cerebral arterial bifurcation.  A CT scan with CT
                                                                 (Over)

     carotid, right external carotid, left common carotid, left internal carotid,
     left external carotid, left subclavian, left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates smooth runoff
     to the arm without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth of the
     right vertebral artery.  The right vertebral artery has a normal cervical
     intracranial course and attributes fluid to the basilar artery and its
     branches into the posterior communicating artery on the left as well as the
     bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.  There is no evidence of stenosis,
     dissection, or intracranial aneurysm.  Injection of the right common carotid
     artery demonstrates a smooth cervical course without evidence of stenosis or
     dissection and a smooth appearing right carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the
     right internal carotid artery demonstrates normal cervical, petrous, and
     intracranial course without evidence of stenosis, dissection or intracranial
     aneurysm. There is evidence of aneurysm located at the origin of the right
     posterior communicating artery measuring approximately 1 1/2 mm in diameter as
     well as the right internal carotid artery bifurcation measuring 1 to 1.5 mm in
     greatest diameter.  Otherwise there is normal contribution to the MCA and its
     branches and to the ACA.  There is no other evidence of intracranial aneurysm
     or stenosis as confirmed by the rotational three dimensional angiography.
     Injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates normal branching
     pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left common carotid artery demonstrates a
     normal cervical course without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth
     appearing left carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the left internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a multilobulated 3 x 6 mm aneurysm at the origin of the
     left posterior communicating artery with a 2 1/2 mm neck as well as a small 2
     to 3 mm aneurysm at the origin of the anterior choroidal artery. At the left
     MCA bifrucation, there is a 3 x 3 mm aneurysm of a 3 mm neck which is not
     amenable to coil embolization.  Otherwise there is no evidence of intracranial
     aneurysms visualized.  However, on the rotational three dimensional views, two
     small aneurysms protruding behind the identified wide neck MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm are seen.  There is no evidence of intracranial stenosis or
     dissection.  Injection of the left external carotid artery demonstrates normal
     branching pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates normal
     runoff to the arm.  No evidence of stenosis or dissection in a smooth
     appearing origin of the left vertebral artery. Injection of the left vertebral
     artery demonstrates a normal cervical and intracranial course without evidence
     of aneurysm, stenosis or dissection.

     carotid, right external carotid, left common carotid, left internal carotid,
     left external carotid, left subclavian, left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates smooth runoff
     to the arm without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth of the
     right vertebral artery.  The right vertebral artery has a normal cervical
     intracranial course and attributes fluid to the basilar artery and its
     branches into the posterior communicating artery on the left as well as the
     bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.  There is no evidence of stenosis,
     dissection, or intracranial aneurysm.  Injection of the right common carotid
     artery demonstrates a smooth cervical course without evidence of stenosis or
     dissection and a smooth appearing right carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the
     right internal carotid artery demonstrates normal cervical, petrous, and
     intracranial course without evidence of stenosis, dissection or intracranial
     aneurysm. There is evidence of aneurysm located at the origin of the right
     posterior communicating artery measuring approximately 1 1/2 mm in diameter as
     well as the right internal carotid artery bifurcation measuring 1 to 1.5 mm in
     greatest diameter.  Otherwise there is normal contribution to the MCA and its
     branches and to the ACA.  There is no other evidence of intracranial aneurysm
     or stenosis as confirmed by the rotational three dimensional angiography.
     Injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates normal branching
     pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left common carotid artery demonstrates a
     normal cervical course without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth
     appearing left carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the left internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a multilobulated 3 x 6 mm aneurysm at the origin of the
     left posterior communicating artery with a 2 1/2 mm neck as well as a small 2
     to 3 mm aneurysm at the origin of the anterior choroidal artery. At the left
     MCA bifrucation, there is a 3 x 3 mm aneurysm of a 3 mm neck which is not
     amenable to coil embolization.  Otherwise there is no evidence of intracranial
     aneurysms visualized.  However, on the rotational three dimensional views, two
     small aneurysms protruding behind the identified wide neck MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm are seen.  There is no evidence of intracranial stenosis or
     dissection.  Injection of the left external carotid artery demonstrates normal
     branching pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates normal
     runoff to the arm.  No evidence of stenosis or dissection in a smooth
     appearing origin of the left vertebral artery. Injection of the left vertebral
     artery demonstrates a normal cervical and intracranial course without evidence
     of aneurysm, stenosis or dissection.

     carotid, right external carotid, left common carotid, left internal carotid,
     left external carotid, left subclavian, left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates smooth runoff
     to the arm without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth of the
     right vertebral artery.  The right vertebral artery has a normal cervical
     intracranial course and attributes fluid to the basilar artery and its
     branches into the posterior communicating artery on the left as well as the
     bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.  There is no evidence of stenosis,
     dissection, or intracranial aneurysm.  Injection of the right common carotid
     artery demonstrates a smooth cervical course without evidence of stenosis or
     dissection and a smooth appearing right carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the
     right internal carotid artery demonstrates normal cervical, petrous, and
     intracranial course without evidence of stenosis, dissection or intracranial
     aneurysm. There is evidence of aneurysm located at the origin of the right
     posterior communicating artery measuring approximately 1 1/2 mm in diameter as
     well as the right internal carotid artery bifurcation measuring 1 to 1.5 mm in
     greatest diameter.  Otherwise there is normal contribution to the MCA and its
     branches and to the ACA.  There is no other evidence of intracranial aneurysm
     or stenosis as confirmed by the rotational three dimensional angiography.
     Injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates normal branching
     pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left common carotid artery demonstrates a
     normal cervical course without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth
     appearing left carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the left internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a multilobulated 3 x 6 mm aneurysm at the origin of the
     left posterior communicating artery with a 2 1/2 mm neck as well as a small 2
     to 3 mm aneurysm at the origin of the anterior choroidal artery. At the left
     MCA bifrucation, there is a 3 x 3 mm aneurysm of a 3 mm neck which is not
     amenable to coil embolization.  Otherwise there is no evidence of intracranial
     aneurysms visualized.  However, on the rotational three dimensional views, two
     small aneurysms protruding behind the identified wide neck MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm are seen.  There is no evidence of intracranial stenosis or
     dissection.  Injection of the left external carotid artery demonstrates normal
     branching pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates normal
     runoff to the arm.  No evidence of stenosis or dissection in a smooth
     appearing origin of the left vertebral artery. Injection of the left vertebral
     artery demonstrates a normal cervical and intracranial course without evidence
     of aneurysm, stenosis or dissection.

     carotid, right external carotid, left common carotid, left internal carotid,
     left external carotid, left subclavian, left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates smooth runoff
     to the arm without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth of the
     right vertebral artery.  The right vertebral artery has a normal cervical
     intracranial course and attributes fluid to the basilar artery and its
     branches into the posterior communicating artery on the left as well as the
     bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.  There is no evidence of stenosis,
     dissection, or intracranial aneurysm.  Injection of the right common carotid
     artery demonstrates a smooth cervical course without evidence of stenosis or
     dissection and a smooth appearing right carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the
     right internal carotid artery demonstrates normal cervical, petrous, and
     intracranial course without evidence of stenosis, dissection or intracranial
     aneurysm. There is evidence of aneurysm located at the origin of the right
     posterior communicating artery measuring approximately 1 1/2 mm in diameter as
     well as the right internal carotid artery bifurcation measuring 1 to 1.5 mm in
     greatest diameter.  Otherwise there is normal contribution to the MCA and its
     branches and to the ACA.  There is no other evidence of intracranial aneurysm
     or stenosis as confirmed by the rotational three dimensional angiography.
     Injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates normal branching
     pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left common carotid artery demonstrates a
     normal cervical course without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth
     appearing left carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the left internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a multilobulated 3 x 6 mm aneurysm at the origin of the
     left posterior communicating artery with a 2 1/2 mm neck as well as a small 2
     to 3 mm aneurysm at the origin of the anterior choroidal artery. At the left
     MCA bifrucation, there is a 3 x 3 mm aneurysm of a 3 mm neck which is not
     amenable to coil embolization.  Otherwise there is no evidence of intracranial
     aneurysms visualized.  However, on the rotational three dimensional views, two
     small aneurysms protruding behind the identified wide neck MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm are seen.  There is no evidence of intracranial stenosis or
     dissection.  Injection of the left external carotid artery demonstrates normal
     branching pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates normal
     runoff to the arm.  No evidence of stenosis or dissection in a smooth
     appearing origin of the left vertebral artery. Injection of the left vertebral
     artery demonstrates a normal cervical and intracranial course without evidence
     of aneurysm, stenosis or dissection.

     carotid, right external carotid, left common carotid, left internal carotid,
     left external carotid, left subclavian, left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right subclavian artery demonstrates smooth runoff
     to the arm without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth of the
     right vertebral artery.  The right vertebral artery has a normal cervical
     intracranial course and attributes fluid to the basilar artery and its
     branches into the posterior communicating artery on the left as well as the
     bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.  There is no evidence of stenosis,
     dissection, or intracranial aneurysm.  Injection of the right common carotid
     artery demonstrates a smooth cervical course without evidence of stenosis or
     dissection and a smooth appearing right carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the
     right internal carotid artery demonstrates normal cervical, petrous, and
     intracranial course without evidence of stenosis, dissection or intracranial
     aneurysm. There is evidence of aneurysm located at the origin of the right
     posterior communicating artery measuring approximately 1 1/2 mm in diameter as
     well as the right internal carotid artery bifurcation measuring 1 to 1.5 mm in
     greatest diameter.  Otherwise there is normal contribution to the MCA and its
     branches and to the ACA.  There is no other evidence of intracranial aneurysm
     or stenosis as confirmed by the rotational three dimensional angiography.
     Injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates normal branching
     pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left common carotid artery demonstrates a
     normal cervical course without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth
     appearing left carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the left internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a multilobulated 3 x 6 mm aneurysm at the origin of the
     left posterior communicating artery with a 2 1/2 mm neck as well as a small 2
     to 3 mm aneurysm at the origin of the anterior choroidal artery. At the left
     MCA bifrucation, there is a 3 x 3 mm aneurysm of a 3 mm neck which is not
     amenable to coil embolization.  Otherwise there is no evidence of intracranial
     aneurysms visualized.  However, on the rotational three dimensional views, two
     small aneurysms protruding behind the identified wide neck MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm are seen.  There is no evidence of intracranial stenosis or
     dissection.  Injection of the left external carotid artery demonstrates normal
     branching pattern without evidence of fistulous connection to the intracranial
     circulation.  Injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates normal
     runoff to the arm.  No evidence of stenosis or dissection in a smooth
     appearing origin of the left vertebral artery. Injection of the left vertebral
     artery demonstrates a normal cervical and intracranial course without evidence
     of aneurysm, stenosis or dissection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple intracranial aneurysms as described above including a
     left posterior communicating artery, left anterior choroidal artery, left MCA
     bifurcation, right posterior communicating artery and right ICA bifurcation
     aneurysm not amenable to coil embolization.

Date of Birth:  [**3263-5-29**]             Sex:   M
 
Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5184**] 
Addendum:
See previous discharge summary for events up to [**3320-2-2**]. 

After his sodium normalized he was transferred from the ICU to 
the neurology floor.  During his ICU stay, he spiked to 102.7 on 
[**1-26**], and blood cx and urine cx were done.  Blood cx returned 
[**3-11**] positive for MSSA.  UA was positive for enterobacter 
pansensitive.  The bacteremia was thought to be due to an 
arterial line infection, thus the line was pulled and he was 
started on vancomycin [**Date range (1) 5185**].  Antibiotics were changed to 
oxacillin on [**1-30**] as sensitivities came back sensitive to 
oxacillin.  Repeat blood cultures were drawn on [**2-1**] and [**5-13**] 
grew MSSA, on [**2-2**] one out of two bottles + MSSA, [**2-4**] & [**2-6**] - 
NGTD.  He was continued on oxacillin per ID recs.  In addition, 
TTE and TEE were negative for endocarditis.  He will continue a 
bacteremia workup on the medicine service that includes CT chest 
and WBC scan to look for osteomyelitis.  He was subsequently 
found to have aspiration pneumonia and UTI was treated with 
clinda and cipro.  f/u Urine cx on [**2-4**] showed no growth.  LFTs 
should be followed as patient is on oxacillin.  

On [**2-2**], he was found to be in rapid afib while getting his TTE. 
 He was sent back to the floor and cardiology was consulted.  
His metoprolol was increased and aspirin was started.  TEE 
showed EF 50-55%, simple atheromas, + PFO, 1+ MR, 1+ AI.  

He is currently being trasferred to the medicine service for 
further management of his medical issues.  

HOSPITAL COURSE FROM TIME OF TRANSFER TO MEDICINE ON [**3320-2-6**]:

HPI: 56 yo M with remote h/o tob, EtOH, migraines, cataract 
surgery, p/w 5-6 weeks of progressive worsening HA, then 
developed left eye ptosis, double vision and was admitted on 
[**3320-1-17**].  Subsequently found to have multiple (at least 
5)aneurysms on MRI now s/p clipping of 2 of those aneurysms, the 
Left MCA and Posterior communicating artery. Post op course was 
intially complicated by hyponatremia attributed to SIADH, now 
resolved, high grade MSSA bacteremia on [**1-26**] ([**3-11**]) secondary to 
a line infection (also cultured MSSA) with persistent bactermeia 
on 2/24([**5-13**] still positive for MSSA), switched from vancomycin 
(started [**2-5**]) to oxacillin on [**1-30**], now s/p negative TEE, chest 
CT showing possible septic emboli in addition to possible 
aspiration pneumonia, and with new onset afib, now in sinus 
rhythm.  He is transferred to medicine service from neurosurgery 
on [**2-6**]. 
.
At this time he reports some difficulty with word 
finding/cognition that he thinks has improved since surgery. He 
denies double vision, light-headedness, dizziness or headache.
Additionally, he complains of cough with mucous production that 
he feels has worsened over the past few days.  He denies fevers, 
chills, night sweats, chest pain or shortness of breath.  Denies 
hemoptysis. Reports feeling some fatigue from everything he has 
been through.    Denies abdominal complaints including abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, 
melena. No fecal incontinence.  Denies dysuria, incontinence or 
hesitancy or incomplete voiding. He denies other 
pains/arthralgias.  Says his former picc site is not painful, 
does have soreness at current IV site.

HOSPITAL COURSE [**2-6**] on: This is a 56 y/o with h/o smoking, 
alcohol abuse, migraines who presented with headaches, CNIII 
nerve palsy on [**1-17**] admited to neurosurgery found to have 
multiple intracranial aneurysms incl l mca aneurysm with mass 
affect, now 2 of which are s/p clipping. Post-op course 
complicated by hyponatremia/SIadh now resolved, afib-also now 
resolved in NSR, and high grade MSSA bacteremia with current 
work-up ongoing for possible localizing source
.
1)Infectious Disease: On transfer to medical service on [**2-6**], 
patient with high grade bacteremia-MSSA since [**1-26**]-still 
positive on [**2-1**], switched from vanc to ox on [**1-30**], TEE 
negative.  Because of high grade bacteremia, surveillance 
cultures were sent on [**2-5**], [**2-6**], [**2-7**] and were all negative.  
Additionally, patient underwent chest x-ray on [**2-5**] then CT of 
chest on [**2-6**] which showed multiple septic embolic presumed 
secondary to MSSA bacteremia.  Given negative TEE, other sources 
were investigated as possible source. Patient subsequently 
underwent CT abdomen which showed no abdominal source, WBC scan 
which showed some enhanced uptake in right anterior skull.  
Neurosurgery reviewed study and does not feel there is 
indication for drainage. MR/MRA of head was then done to better 
assess this area and showed no specific abnormalities. Of note, 
that patient has been afebrile throughout this time, with 
negative surveillance cultures and is without change in 
symptomatology or neuro exam.  Given that he has had no clinical 
neurologic change and has been afebrile throughout this time 
with negative surveillance cultures, in consultation with ID and 
neurosurgery, medicine team does ot feel as though patient has 
mycotic aneurysm or other concerning fluid collection/source of 
infection that warrants intervention at this time.
The patient was continued on IV oxacillin and will receive 6 
weeks starting from [**2-5**] which is the first day of negative 
cultures.  Additionally, will need ID follow-up, along with 
weekl lft's and cbc's to assess for oxacillin toxicity. As 
further work-up for other possible sources and to complete basic 
ID work-up, urine, c. diff, stool, o and p studies were sent and 
all returned negative.  
Additinoally, patient was treated for a separate pneumonia: He 
received a seven day course of clindamycin/cipro.

2)cardiac: ischemia: Patient was maintained on aspirin for 
primary prophylaxis.
pump: low nl ef, pfo, some evid of fluid by chest CT, no 
vegetations by TEE.  Attempt was kept to maintain patient 
euvolemic, and patient maintained on metoprolol.
rhythm: Patient had  episode of afib before transfter to 
medicine.  He was in NSR while on the medicine service.  A fib 
was felt likely 2nd to incre adrenergic tone with intracranial 
process.  He was maintained on metoprolol.  Decision was made 
not to  anti-coag given risk for brain bleed. 
3) renal: hyponatremia attributed to SIADH--Patient was 
continued on fluid restriction and remained normo-natremic 
throughout his stay on the medicine service.

4)GI: Patient with elevated LFT's on transfer, felt possibly [**1-10**] 
oxacillin.  LFT's were normal on discharge (from [**2-13**]).  Will 
need to be monitored on oxacillin.
Also with some diarrhea which was improving on discharge.  Says 
he had some diarrhea before coming to hospital.  Sent stool 
studies, o and p (wife with history of parasitic infection-works 
with handicapped children), and repeated c. diff which were all 
negative.
Nutrition: Patient had poor PO intake throughout hospital 
course.  He says that this is his baseline and as a truck driver 
he just doesn't eat much.  Nutrition recommended consideration 
of g-tube or ng tube but patient did not desire and medical team 
felt that given patient has ability to eat and no cause for his 
poor intake other than his usual habits, did not place ng tube.  
We have provided extensive education, encouragement and he has 
been followed by nutrition.

5)neuro: Patient had no major neurologic issues while on the 
medicine service. He was followed by neurosurgery.  No 
neurologic changes noted.  Mental status continues to progress 
to baseline.   Left subdural/epidural collection has 
significantly diminished in size.  

6)Patient maintained on heparin subcu and famotidine for DVT and 
GI prophylaxis respectively.

Patient had PICC line placed on [**2-12**] for IV antibiotic course.

Urine: [**1-26**] enterobacter aerogenes 10-100,000
[**2-4**] and [**2-7**] negative

stool: [**2-11**] negative, also o and p negative

c. diff: [**2-2**] and [**2-11**] negative

[**2-5**] TEE:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. A patent foramen ovale is 
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is 
seen at rest. 
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). 
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. 
4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are 
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 
5.There are three aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. 
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. 
7.There is no pericardial effusion. 

[**2-6**] chest ct:CT CHEST FOLLOWING IV CONTRAST: 
 
There are slightly enlarged right hilar and precarinal lymph[**MD Number 2082**]. There is 
no pericardial effusion. The heart size is at the upper limits 
of normal. 
 
There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. 
Multiple 
nodules are seen predominantly within the right lung. Several 
are cavitated. 
Additionally, there are diffuse peripheral ground-glass 
opacities bilaterally. 
There is a moderate amount of compressive atelectasis at the 
right base. There 
is opacity at the left base out of proportion to the adjacent 
effusion. No 
suspicious lesions are seen within the bones. There is a left 
exophytic renal 
cyst. A granuloma is seen within the liver. 
 
Within segment 6 of the liver is a 1 cm area of abnormal 
enhancement with 
smooth margins. There is early filling of an adhacent segment of 
hepatic 
vein. This suggests a portal/hepatic venous fistuliza or 
vascular lesion with 
shunting. Has the patient had biopsy or instrumentation in this 
region? This 
area could be further assessed with ultrasound or MRI if 
indicated 
IMPRESSION: 
 
1) Cavitary and noncavitary nodules, which are highly suggesive 
of septic 
emboli in this patient with history of staph bacteremia.  
 
2) Evidence of a vascular lesion in the right posterior liver 
(segment VI). 
Correlation with ultrasound may be helpful for further 
characterization. 

[**2-6**] CT abdomen:CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: 
There are small bilateral 
pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. The liver, 
gallbladder, 
spleen, and pancreas are unremarkable. The kidneys and adrenal 
glands are 
within normal limits with the exception of a simple cyst in the 
lower pole of 
the right kidney which measures 1.7 x 2.0 cm. The stomach and 
opacified loops 
of small bowel are of unremarkable appearance. There is a small 
hiatal 
hernia. There is no free fluid in the abdomen. There is no free 
air in the 
abdomen. There is diverticular disease without evidence of 
diverticulitis. No 
intra-abdominal abscess was identified. The appendix was not 
identified, but 
there is no evidence of appendicitis. There are multiple 
mesenteric small 
lymph[**MD Number 298**] that do not meet CT criteria for pathology. There 
are no 
significant retroperitoneal lymph[**MD Number 298**]. 
 
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: There is 
diverticular disease of 
the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis. The 
opacified 
intrapelvic bowel loops are unremarkable. The distal ureters and 
urinary 
bladder are unremarkable. The prostate is unremarkable. There is 
no free 
fluid or free air in the pelvis. 
 
BONE WINDOWS: There is a mild left convex scoliosis. There are 
degenerative 
changes of the lumbar spine. There are no suspicious lytic or 
blastic 
lesions. 
 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No intra-abdominal source for MSSA bacteremia was identified. 

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
3. Atelectasis vs pneumonia in the lung bases.  

[**2-9**] WBC scan:
INTERPRETATION: Following the injection of autologous white 
blood cells labeled 
with Indium-111, images of the whole body, wrists and skull were 
obtained at 24 
hours. These images show increased tracer uptake within the 
right lateral 
frontal skull and parts of the overlying soft tissues. On the 
static images of 
the wrist, there is a small focus of increased tracer activity 
in the right 
wrist. This is rather subtle. No other areas of abnormal tracer 
uptake are 
identified.  
 
The above findings are consistent with infection in the right 
frontal and 
lateral skull. There is also possibly a small focus of infection 
within the 
right wrist.  
 
IMPRESSION: Uptake of radiolabeled white blood cells within the 
right anterior 
skull. There is also a subtle increased uptake in the right 
wrist. These are 
consistent with infections in these sites.  
/nkg 

3/5MR/MRA
BRAIN MRI: 
 
On the diffusion images, no evidence of acute infarct is seen. 
There is a 
left frontal extra-axial hematoma identified with mixed signal 
intensities. 
Postoperative changes are seen in this region with craniotomy 
for aneurysm 
clipping. Artifacts are seen in the left supraclinoid region and 
projected 
over the left temporal lobe secondary to aneurysm clipping. 
There is no 
midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus seen. Small amount 
of blood 
products are seen in the subarachnoid space and along the sulci 
at convexity. 
 
Following gadolinium administration, there is no evidence of 
abnormal 
parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen. There are 
no signs of 
cerebritis or cerebral abscess. There is also no significant 
enhancement seen 
along the left frontal extra-axial collection. 
 
IMPRESSION: Status post aneurysm clipping. No evidence of acute 
infarct. 
Left frontal extra-axial collection due to hematoma as on the CT 
of [**3320-1-27**]. 
No abnormal enhancement seen. 
 
MRA OF THE HEAD: 
 
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the right 
carotid circulation 
and in the posterior circulation. The flow signal in the left 
middle cerebral 
artery is not visualized, which most likely secondary to 
artifacts from the 
adjacent aneurysm clip. Subtle flow signal is identified in the 
branches of 
the left sylvian fissure indicating perfusion in this region. 
 
IMPRESSION: Proximal left middle cerebral artery flow signal is 
obscured by 
artifact from adjacent clips. No other abnormalities. It should 
be noted 
that the MRA examination is not a sensitive method for 
evaluation for mycotic 
aneurysm.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Clipping, left MCA aneurysm.  Evaluate for stroke.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head was obtained, correlated with a prior
     MR performed 2 days ago.
     
     FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the posterior fossa is limited by dental metal. Also,
     the recently placed clip creates significant metallic artifact especially
     within the left middle cranial fossa.  There is no intracranial hemorrhage,
     mass effect, or shift of normally mid-line structures.  There is
     pneumocephalus associated from the recent procedure.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
     differentiation is preserved.  Extra-axial spaces appear within normal limits.
      Craniotomy defect is seen, and there is mucosal thickening within the left
     frontal and ethmoid sinuses, with air fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or abnormal loss of [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-
     white differentiation.  Appropriate post-operative appearance of the head.
     Please note that MRI with diffusion weighted imaging is a more sensitive
     evaluation for stroke.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o stroke                                                                      
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post clipping of left MCA and left PCOM
     aneursym.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with no evidence of branch occlusion.  No
     evidence of aneurysmal remnant.
     
     INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1590**] is a 56 year old male who was diagnosed to have a left
     posterior communicating artery aneurysm and a left MCA aneurysm following a
     presentation with a left 3rd nerve palsy.  He underwent left-sided craniotomy
     for clipping of the MCA and PCOM aneurysms as well as wrapping of small
     anterior choroidal 2 mm aneurysm.  Postoperatively while awakening up, the
     patient was noted not to be moving right side as briskly as his left.  CAT
     scan did not demonstrate the presence of any stroke.  He undergoes this
     diagnostic angiogram to rule out embolism and branch occlusion.
     
     CONSENT:   The patient and his wife were given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure.  Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient and his wife understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     The left common carotid artery, left internal carotid artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the left common carotid artery reveals smooth appearing

     aneurysms have been clipped by MRI-compatible Stainless Steel [**Hospital1 1593**] SlimLine
     aneurysm clips. All branches of the MCA and ACA territories appear to be

       56 year old man with  r weakness post L MCA aneurysm clipping                  
                                              
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o stroke                                                                      
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post clipping of left MCA and left PCOM
     aneursym.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with no evidence of branch occlusion.  No
     evidence of aneurysmal remnant.
     
     INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1590**] is a 56 year old male who was diagnosed to have a left
     posterior communicating artery aneurysm and a left MCA aneurysm following a
     presentation with a left 3rd nerve palsy.  He underwent left-sided craniotomy
     for clipping of the MCA and PCOM aneurysms as well as wrapping of small
     anterior choroidal 2 mm aneurysm.  Postoperatively while awakening up, the
     patient was noted not to be moving right side as briskly as his left.  CAT
     scan did not demonstrate the presence of any stroke.  He undergoes this
     diagnostic angiogram to rule out embolism and branch occlusion.
     
     CONSENT:   The patient and his wife were given a full and complete explanation
     of the procedure.  Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits and
     alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient and his wife understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     The left common carotid artery, left internal carotid artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the left common carotid artery reveals smooth appearing
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     cervical segment without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth
     appearing left carotid bifurcation.  Injection of the left internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a small amount of fibromuscular dysplasia within the
     cervical petrous junction.  The aneurysm clips are well visualized.  There
     does not appear to be any aneurysmal remnant on biplane or rotational
     angiographic images.  The small anterior choroidal aneurysm is identified
     unchanged in appearance from the previous study.  Both left PCOM and left MCA
     aneurysms have been clipped by MRI-compatible Stainless Steel [**Hospital1 1593**] SlimLine
     aneurysm clips. All branches of the MCA and ACA territories appear to be
     filling briskly. There is no evidence of branch occlusion, stenosis or other
     dissection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of aneurysmal remnant at either the left PCom or left
     MCA bifurcation aneurysm location. There is also no evidence of branch
     occlusion postoperatively with a widely patent anterior choroidal arterial
     flow.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      56 year old man s/p aneurysm clipping                                           
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      new drift                                                                       
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Aneurysm clipping.  New drift.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast CT of the head was obtained, and compared with
     [**3320-1-15**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The examination is limited by motion artifact.
     
     There appears to be slight hyperdensity in the right parietal lobe at the
     skull vertex, which was not evident on the prior examination.  This may
     represent very minimal subarachnoid blood.
     
     There is also a large right frontal extra-axial collection which has developed
     over the interval, which at thickest measures approximately 1.5 cm in size
     over the left frontal region. This is directly below the area of soft tissue
     swelling demarcated by skin staples.  In the prior examination, there was
     considerably less blood of varying chronicity as well as air at this location.
     The sulci in the region of the right extraaxial hemorrhage are effaced,
     although there is no significant shift of normally midline structures at this
     time. The [**Doctor Last Name 66**]/white matter differentiation is preserved. Multiple metallic
     clips are seen in the region of the left temporal lobe and middle cranial
     fossa, from prior aneurysm clipping.  A small mucous retension cyst is also
     present in the left maxillary sinus.
     
     IMPRESSION
     1.  Left extra-axial frontal collection. This appears to have a subdural and
     epidural component  collection in this postoperative patient.
     2.  There may also be very minimal subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right
     parietal lobe.
     
     The findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1598**] at 8:30 AM, [**3320-1-27**].

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post craniotomy procedure.  Question pneumonia.
     
     The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is increased pulmonary
     vascularity caliber.  Bibasilar pulmonary opacities are again demonstrated
     with adjacent pleural effusions, and appear unchanged.  There is a patchy
     rounded opacity in the right upper lobe anteriorly with an equivocal area of
     cavitation.  This appears unchanged in retrospect from [**3320-2-4**] but
     is new compared to [**3320-1-23**].  The lung volumes appear increased.  The
     skeletal structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Stable findings which likely represent CHF superimposed upon emphysema with
     associated small pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
     
     More focal right upper lobe opacity with questionable cavitation, which could
     represent a focal necrotizing pneumonia.

     INDICATION:  MSSA bacteremia and cavitary lung nodule.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric images were obtained through the chest following 150 ml
     of Optiray.  Images are reviewed in 5 and 2.5 mm of collimation.
     
     Comparison is made to radiograph from [**3320-2-5**] and [**3320-1-18**].
     
     CT CHEST FOLLOWING IV CONTRAST:
     
     There are slightly enlarged right hilar and precarinal lymph nodes.  There is
     no pericardial effusion.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
     
     There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Multiple
     nodules are seen predominantly within the right lung.  Several are cavitated.
     Additionally, there are diffuse peripheral ground-glass opacities bilaterally.
     There is a moderate amount of compressive atelectasis at the right base. There
     is opacity at the left base out of proportion to the adjacent effusion. No
     suspicious lesions are seen within the bones.  There is a left exophytic renal
     cyst.  A granuloma is seen within the liver.
     
     Within segment 6 of the liver is a 1 cm area of abnormal enhancement with
     smooth margins.  There is early filling of an adhacent segment of hepatic
     vein.  This suggests a portal/hepatic venous fistuliza or vascular lesion with
     shunting.  Has the patient had biopsy or instrumentation in this region? This
     area could be further assessed with ultrasound or MRI if indicated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Cavitary and noncavitary nodules, which are highly suggesive of septic
     emboli in this patient with history of staph bacteremia. 
     
     2)  Evidence of a vascular lesion in the right posterior liver (segment VI).
     Correlation with ultrasound may be helpful for further characterization.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      56 year old man with ? cavitation in lung, pneumonia.  Persist bacteremia with 
      MSSA. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please assess for a cavitation in lung.  Thank [**Doctor First Name 14**].                             
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  MSSA bacteremia and cavitary lung nodule.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric images were obtained through the chest following 150 ml
     of Optiray.  Images are reviewed in 5 and 2.5 mm of collimation.
     
     Comparison is made to radiograph from [**3320-2-5**] and [**3320-1-18**].
     
     CT CHEST FOLLOWING IV CONTRAST:
     
     There are slightly enlarged right hilar and precarinal lymph nodes.  There is
     no pericardial effusion.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
     
     There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Multiple
     nodules are seen predominantly within the right lung.  Several are cavitated.
     Additionally, there are diffuse peripheral ground-glass opacities bilaterally.
     There is a moderate amount of compressive atelectasis at the right base. There
     is opacity at the left base out of proportion to the adjacent effusion. No
     suspicious lesions are seen within the bones.  There is a left exophytic renal
     cyst.  A granuloma is seen within the liver.
     
     Within segment 6 of the liver is a 1 cm area of abnormal enhancement with
     smooth margins.  There is early filling of an adhacent segment of hepatic
     vein.  This suggests a portal/hepatic venous fistuliza or vascular lesion with
     shunting.  Has the patient had biopsy or instrumentation in this region? This
     area could be further assessed with ultrasound or MRI if indicated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Cavitary and noncavitary nodules, which are highly suggesive of septic
     emboli in this patient with history of staph bacteremia. 
     
     2)  Evidence of a vascular lesion in the right posterior liver (segment VI).
     Correlation with ultrasound may be helpful for further characterization.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-six year old man, s/p craniotomy for an aneurysm repair with  
     bacteremia, evaluate for infection.   
      
     DECISION:  Spot views of the wrists and skull were performed.  These were in
     addition to the whole body scan. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following the injection of autologous white blood cells labeled
     with Indium-111, images of the whole body, wrists and skull were obtained at 24
     hours.  These images show increased tracer uptake within the right lateral
     frontal skull and parts of the overlying soft tissues.  On the static images of
     the wrist, there is a small focus of increased tracer activity in the right
     wrist.  This is rather subtle.  No other areas of abnormal tracer uptake are
     identified. 
      
     The above findings are consistent with infection in the right frontal and
     lateral skull.  There is also possibly a small focus of infection within the
     right wrist.   
      
     IMPRESSION:  Uptake of radiolabeled white blood cells within the right anterior
     skull.  There is also a subtle increased uptake in the right wrist.  These are
     consistent with infections in these sites.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  56-year-old man status post craniotomy with diminished breath
     sounds, low oxygen saturation.  Evaluate for pneumonia and pleural effusion.
     
     PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**3320-2-9**] is compared to the CT of the chest
     dated [**3320-2-6**], and PA and lateral chest x-ray of [**3320-2-5**].  Emphysematous
     changes are noted throughout the lungs bilaterally.  The left-sided pleural
     effusion has not changed in size or appearance.  Right-sided pleural effusion,
     however, has increased in size.  There is increased density in the right lower
     lobe, which may represent atelectasis or consolidation.  Again, seen is an
     opacity within the right upper lobe with question of central cavitation which
     has not changed in appearance.  This patient has a history of septic emboli,
     which this abnormality is likely secondary to.  The heart and mediastinal
     contours are unchanged.  The surrounding osseous and soft tissue.  Structures
     are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Increased size of right pleural effusion with associated increased density
     of the right lower lung lobe, which likely represents atelectasis or
     consolidation.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
     2) Stable right upper lobe opacity a likely central cavitation which is
     probably secondary to septic embolus in this region.
     3.  Emphysematous changes bilaterally.

      56 year old man with high grade MSSA bacteremia, septic pulmonary emboli, 
      unclear source for both, now with indication of inflammation in R brain/skull 
      on wbc scan.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please also perform MRA to evaluate for intravascular source of MSSA, mycotic 
      aneurysms, and MRI with gadolinium to evaluate for osteo/source of infection 
      corresponding with evidence of infxn. on wbc scan yesterday.

     EXAM:  MRI brain.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  The patient is status post clipping for aneurysm with
     high-grade MSSA bacteremia and septic pulmonary emboli of unclear source for
     further evaluation to exclude intracranial abnormalities including mycotic
     aneurysms.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR T2 susceptibility, and diffusion
     axial images of the brain were acquired.  3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle
     of [**Location (un) 309**] was obtained.
     
     BRAIN MRI:
     
     On the diffusion images, no evidence of acute infarct is seen.  There is a
     left frontal extra-axial hematoma identified with mixed signal intensities.
     Postoperative changes are seen in this region with craniotomy for aneurysm
     clipping.  Artifacts are seen in the left supraclinoid region and projected
     over the left temporal lobe secondary to aneurysm clipping.  There is no
     midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus seen.  Small amount of blood
     products are seen in the subarachnoid space and along the sulci at convexity.
     
     Following gadolinium administration, there is no evidence of abnormal
     parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.  There are no signs of
     cerebritis or cerebral abscess.  There is also no significant enhancement seen
     along the left frontal extra-axial collection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post aneurysm clipping.  No evidence of acute infarct.
     Left frontal extra-axial collection due to hematoma as on the CT of [**3320-1-27**].
     No abnormal enhancement seen.
     
     MRA OF THE HEAD:
     
     The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the right carotid circulation
     and in the posterior circulation.  The flow signal in the left middle cerebral
     artery is not visualized, which most likely secondary to artifacts from the
     adjacent aneurysm clip.  Subtle flow signal is identified in the branches of
