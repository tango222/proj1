abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
88F with h/o DM, CHF, afib, recent pneumonia (Zosyn) and C diff 
(course of Flagyl), among other med issues, presents with one 
day of abdominal pain. Pain began at epigastrium and migrated by 
presentation to ED to hypogastrium, and finally localized to RLQ 
at time of admission. No N/V/BRBPR. Diarrhea per recent c diff, 
but normal BM yesterday was her last BM. Dark stools secondary 
to iron supplementation, but guiaic neg in ED. Pt denies nausea 
per se, but had one episode of emesis yesterday brought on by 
coughing spell.
   Additional issues for this admission developed as patient was 
in rapid afib in ED, tachypneic, and had B diffuse crackles on 
lung exam. O2 sats stable on 100%, but patients normal 
requirement is only 2L. CPAP was attempted in ED, but patient 
refused and became agitated. After multiple doses of Diltiazem 
IV brought pulse rate to 90's, O2 was pulled back to 4L and O2 
sat was 98%.
   Patient has had multiple admissions recently for pulmonary 
edema, at [**Hospital1 1220**] and [**Hospital1 25**], treated effectively with diuresis and 
diltiazem drip when patient in rapid afib.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for obervation and control of her rapid a-fib.  
It was hoped that controling the a-fib would help resolve her 
CHF.  She was started on a diltiazem drip and on HD 1 her HR 
began to normalize.  On HD 2 pt's abdominal pain worsened and 
she was taken to the OR where she was found to have a possible 
right ovarian mass and necrotic small bowel.  She underwent an 
exploratory laporotomy, lysis of adheasions, repair of 
enterotomy, resection of small bowel, and right oopherectomy.  

Postoperatively she was noted to have a significantly decreased 
urine output, and a nephrology consult was obtained.  By HD3 
(POD1) the pt's creatinine had increased to 3.1 from 2.1.  
Nephrology confirmed the diagnosis of post IV-contrast 
nephropathy.  Pt was monitored in the SICU for the following 4 
days to monitor closely her volume and renal status.  It was 
during this time that she developed one episode of hemoptosis 
after her swan was wedged.  The swan was removed and a CT 
surgery consult was obtained when a chest x-ray was read as 
having a possibly widened mediastienem.  CT showed no 
abnormality and CT surgery signed off.  Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 4622**] urine 
output was at this time minimally responsive to lasix, and her 
creatinine ultimately peaked at a value of 4.1.  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] 
slowly improved and was moved to the floor.  Her creatinine 
slowly dropped to a new baseline of 2.2.  

On POD 11 she developed diarrhea and the suspicion of repeat 
c.diff enterocolitis was confirmed.  Pt was started on flagyl, 
but her white counts remained persistently elevated and a UTI of 
a poly resistant klebsiella grew.  ID was consulted and an 
antibiotic regimen of vanco PO and ceftriaxone IV was initiated. 
 

On several occations, pt's PO2 dropped from the mid 90s to the 
high 80s, and her O2 requirement grew.  These episodes occured 
on several nights, but seemed to be related to aspiration of 
thin liquids at night.  A swallow study during the day 
demonstrated no impairment, but aspiration precautions were 
initiated, especially at night.

Pt's WBC continued to increase and Heme-Onc was consulted to 
rule out transformation of her [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4623**] to lukemia.  They 
confirmed that the WBCs were all mature forms, and a combination 
of hydroyurea and epo was started to help resolve the pt's 
anemia and high WBC count.  The pt's wbc peaked at 57'000.  It 
then has declined to a value of 12'200 on [**8-18**].  Heme-onc has 
reccommended that we continue the hydroxyurea and epo and follow 
cbcs with diff every four days or so.  

Pt ultimately was dced to rehab after her coumadin was 
theraputic (INR=2.9), her SaO2 was stable, her diarrhea is 
tapering, her CHF is much improved (now minimal crackles in b/l 
bases, her UTI is being adequately treated, her anemia is 
resolving (hct 33.9), her WBC count is normalizing (last 12.2), 
her heart rate is controled (80s and 90s), and her creatinine is 
much improved (now 2.2).  She still needs to improve her caloric 
intake and begin physical rehab.
