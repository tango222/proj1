Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 217**] 
Chief Complaint:
RIGHT face weakness and inability to speak 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
0.9mg/kg IV t-PA
 
History of Present Illness:
84 yo RHM with multiple vascular risk factors including 
coumadin-na ve atrial fibrillation presents with rapid-onset of 
RIGHT facial weakness and mutism between 10:30-12PM today. He 
was 
seen this morning by his wife who [**Name2 (NI) 5986**] that he was at his 
baseline, talkative, without focal wekanes, able to move all 
extremities, and able to walk. She left the house at about 10am 
and then received a call from his HHA at approximately 12pm 
reporting the above symptoms to her. They immediately called 911 

and brought the pt to [**Hospital1 25**]. He underwent a head CT which was 
negative for intracranial hemorrhage. An MRI was performed. The 
pt was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2762**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Neurology and an NIH 
Stroke Scale of 12 was determined. The pt received 0.9mg/kg of 
t- 
PA intravenously. The patient was transferred to the ICU for 
close post-procedure monitoring. 
 
Past Medical History:
1) chronic atrial fibrillation  
2) CAD - s/p cath in [**3385**] which revealed LAD occlusion, good  
collateral flow.  
3) pleural pericarditis - Pleural effusion since [**3385**]. In [**3385**], 
the patient underwent a procedure to examine the pleural fluid 
as well as a lung biopsy, both of which did not reveal a clear 
etiology to the source of the patient's effusion. The patient at 
that time also had a pericardial window procedure performed for 
a
pericardial effusion.
4) hypertension  
5) type 2 diabetes  
6) chronic mitral regurgitation  
7) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**Known patient lastname 5987**] was diagnosed with an embolic stroke of the MCA 
territory, his NIH stroke scale was calculated at 12 - he had a 
dense RIGHT facial weakness in an UMN distribution and he was 
essentially mute; he had little observed focal weakness of his 
extremities at this time. He receieved IV t-PA at 0.9mg/kg and 
was transferred to the Neuro-ICU for close monitoring. He 
remained hemodynamically stable there overnight with noticeable 
improvement in his speech. His verbal output greatly increased 
although his speech remains quite dysarthric. He was ruled out 
for MI.
Neurologically, Dr. [**Known patient lastname 5987**] has remained stable with dense RIGHT 
lower facial paresis and dysarthria. He also was noted to have a 
fairly weak gag reflex. He failed his speech and swallow 
evaluation. An NGT was placed for nutritional purposes. Dr. 
[**Known patient lastname 5987**] has been reticent with PT. Because  of his atrial 
fibrillation, he has reluctantly agreed to begin warfarin which 
was started [**3391-12-5**] PM at 5mg QHS. 

The patient has remained hemodynamically stable. He has had some 
evidence of fluid retention with intermitent bibasilar crackles 
and lower extremity edema. He has required several boluses of IV 
furosemide to improve his urine output. His oxygen requirement 
has been 2L NC to mainatin Pox>95%. CXRs have revealed a stable 
chronic RIGHT pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, and some discoid 
atelectasis. He has chronic atrial fibrillation and had episodes 
of recorded tachycardia likely secondary to irregular rate.

At admission, Dr. [**Known patient lastname 5987**] had an indwelling Foley catheter 
because of chronic urinary retention likely secondary to BPH. A 
urinalysis revealed >50 WBCs. Ciprofloxacin was started. The 
patient has completed [**4-28**] day course. Results of UCx are still 
pending. 

With regard to nutrition, Dr. [**Known patient lastname 5987**] failed a speech and swallow 
evaluation with solids and liquids. He was started on tube 
feeding [**3391-12-5**] with Promote w/fiber. Nutrition was consulted.

     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2247**] [**Name (STitle) 2248**] with Dr.
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2234**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 489**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising.  Risks and
     benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient's wife and informed
     consent was obtained over the telephone.  Pre-procedure time-out was performed
     to confirm patient's identity and procedure.
     
     The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The
     stomach was insufflated via a NG tube.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the skin
     overlying the inferior body/antrum of the stomach was locally anesthetized
     with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  With the stomach insufflated, two gastropexy T-
     fasteners were placed percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance using 17-gauge
     needle and secured to the skin.  Between the two fasteners, a skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was
     made and a 17-gauge needle was advanced into the stomach, with confirmation by
     aspiration of air from the stomach.  Subsequently, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire
     was inserted through the needle and into the stomach advanced to the duodenum.
     The needle was removed and a 5-French bright tip sheath was advanced over the
     wire.  The dilator was subsequently removed and a 5-French Kumpe catheter was
     advanced over the wire through the cannula until reaching beyond the ligament
     of Treitz.  Subsequently, the Bentson guidewire was exchanged a Super Stiff
     Amplatz guidewire, which was advanced beyond the fourth portion of the
     duodenum.  The 5-French cannula and Kumpe catheter was removed and a 14-French
     peel-away sheath was advanced over the guidewire. Dilator was removed and
     [**Doctor Last Name 1059**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was advanced through the sheath as the
     sheath was peeled away.  Pigtail was performed in the duodenal bulb and the
     catheter secured to the skin with a 0 silk suture.
     
     There were no associated complications.  Radiology nursing provided continuous
     hemodynamic monitoring and conscious sedation for the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful percutaneous placement of a 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 1059**]

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       83 year old man with a stroke and dysphagia, multiple failed swallow  
      evaluations
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please place G-J tube

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  Subdural hemorrhage.  Inability to swallow.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2247**] [**Name (STitle) 2248**] with Dr.
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2234**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 489**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising.  Risks and
     benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient's wife and informed
     consent was obtained over the telephone.  Pre-procedure time-out was performed
     to confirm patient's identity and procedure.
     
     The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The
     stomach was insufflated via a NG tube.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the skin
     overlying the inferior body/antrum of the stomach was locally anesthetized
     with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.  With the stomach insufflated, two gastropexy T-
     fasteners were placed percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance using 17-gauge
     needle and secured to the skin.  Between the two fasteners, a skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was
     made and a 17-gauge needle was advanced into the stomach, with confirmation by
     aspiration of air from the stomach.  Subsequently, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire
     was inserted through the needle and into the stomach advanced to the duodenum.
     The needle was removed and a 5-French bright tip sheath was advanced over the
     wire.  The dilator was subsequently removed and a 5-French Kumpe catheter was
     advanced over the wire through the cannula until reaching beyond the ligament
     of Treitz.  Subsequently, the Bentson guidewire was exchanged a Super Stiff
     Amplatz guidewire, which was advanced beyond the fourth portion of the
     duodenum.  The 5-French cannula and Kumpe catheter was removed and a 14-French
     peel-away sheath was advanced over the guidewire. Dilator was removed and
     [**Doctor Last Name 1059**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was advanced through the sheath as the
     sheath was peeled away.  Pigtail was performed in the duodenal bulb and the
     catheter secured to the skin with a 0 silk suture.
     
     There were no associated complications.  Radiology nursing provided continuous
     hemodynamic monitoring and conscious sedation for the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful percutaneous placement of a 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 1059**]
     gastrojejunostomy catheter.
