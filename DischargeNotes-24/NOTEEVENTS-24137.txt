HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 77-year-old
gentleman who was found down by a neighbor at his home with
altered mental status. The patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital3 879**] where his mental status improved, but was
found to be hypotensive. They were unable to obtain adequate
vascular access at the time, and his hypotension continued.
The patient got a chest x-ray which showed no pneumothorax,
and then a CT of his chest and abdomen which revealed a small
left anterior pneumothorax as well as a liver laceration and
splenic laceration. The patient was transferred from [**Location (un) **]
to the [**Hospital1 4**] for further
evaluation.

The patient arrived to the trauma bay at the [**Hospital1 374**] at which time his GCS was 14 and the
patient's BP was 76/palp, his heart rate was 110, his
respiratory rate was 24. The patient immediately got a left
subclavian Cordis placed and received 2 liters of IV fluid
with which his blood pressure responded appropriately. After
the 2 liters, the patient's blood pressure was 134/52.

FAST examination revealed positive fluid around the liver and
within Morison pouch. Trauma examination revealed at the time
of admission, once again, a temperature of 100.8, pulse rate
of 96, blood pressure of 90/55 which increased to 130/70
after resuscitation, respiratory rate of 24, saturations of
100%. Patient was mentating and conversant, but was
complaining of severe abdominal pain. His lung sounds were
clear. His rate was regular, but tachycardic. His abdomen was
distended and diffusely tender. The patient was guaiac
negative and had normal tone. His extremities were cool with
palpable pulses.

At that time, it was decided the patient was stable. Given
that the patient was stable, it was decided that a CT of the
abdomen would be obtained. However, the patient's mental
status quickly deteriorated. Patient required intubation. An
intubation by the emergency room physician was attempted, but
unfortunately, an esophageal intubation occurred. After
calling anesthesia stat and an anesthesiologist was able to
come down and was unable to intubate the patient despite
several attempts because of laryngeal edema and some bleeding
from the oral cavity.

The patient was masked ventilated throughout the episode. It
was decided that time that a surgical airway needed to be
obtained. Given that the trauma attending and the chief
resident were present, a surgical airway was undertaken. A
cricothyroidotomy was undertaken in the emergency room and 6
French ET tube was placed, and the patient was adequately
ventilated. The patient continued to be hypotensive. Required
multiple fluid resuscitations. The patient was started on
multiple pressors, but remained hypotensive.

The patient was taken immediately to the operating room for
exploration. Once in the operating room, the patient
continued to require massive resuscitation with blood, FFP,
and platelets. So the patient's abdomen was opened, and the
spleen was found to be shattered. A trauma splenectomy was
undertaken. In addition, the large liver laceration was found
at the time which was repaired primarily and a patch of
omentum was placed over the oversewn liver laceration.

Throughout this time, the patient remained hemodynamically
unstable requiring multiple pressors and transfusions. At
this time, given the patient's abdominal distention, the
patient's abdomen was closed with a [**Location (un) 4722**] bag. The patient
was then transferred to the ICU and on several episodes, had
bradycardic episodes. At that time, ACLS protocol was
initiated, and patient was brought back 2 times. But on the
3rd time, the patient quickly deteriorated from a sinus
bradycardia into PEA through which he could not be shocked
despite ACLS protocol.

His rhythm then quickly degenerated to V-fib and the patient
was then pronounced dead at 6 a.m. on [**2836-8-7**].

Pertinent labs: The patient's hematocrit after resuscitation
was a white count of 12, hematocrit of 33.9, platelets of
121. Chem-7 was a sodium 145, potassium 3.8, chloride 111,
bicarbonate of 16, BUN of 7, creatinine of 0.9. Amylase was
101. EtOH was 69.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient had expired on [**2836-8-7**] at 6 a.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Traumatic splenic laceration as well as
traumatic liver laceration.

     HISTORY:  Status post trauma and chest tube placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  One hour prior on [**2836-8-7**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated, and the endotracheal tube
     terminates in the right main stem bronchus.  The left lung is collapsed, and
     the heart and mediastinum are shifted to the left.  Compared to the previous
     study pneumomediastinum and a large right pneumothorax are now present.
     Subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the neck bilaterally and in the left chest
     wall.  There is a new left basilar chest tube.  There is a nasogastric tube
     extending below the left hemidiaphragm.  The position of its tip is uncertain.
     The trauma team was aware of these findings at the time this study was
     obtained.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Endotracheal tube malposition in the right main stem bronchus.  Associated
     collapse of the left lung.
     
     2.  New pneumomediastinum, large right tension pneumothorax, and extensive
     subcutaneous emphysema.
                                                                           DFDkq

     HISTORY:  Trauma.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous studies.
     
     CHEST:  AP supine portable view.  Evaluation is limited by the superimposed
     trauma board structures.  The patient is rotated.  There is mild mediastinal
     widening, which may be a technical artifact of technique and patient rotation.
     The lungs are grossly clear.  There is a very small lateral lucency in the
     left costophrenic angle, which may represent a small pneumothorax.  There is
     no pleural effusion.  No definite fractures are identified.
     
     PELVIS:  AP supine portable view.  Evaluation is limited by the superimposed
     trauma board structures.  There is no evidence of a fracture or malalignment
     on the single view provided.  Degenerative changes are noted in both hip
     joints.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Possible small left pneumothorax.
     2.  No evidence of acute pelvic fracture on limited evaluation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  77-year-old male status post trauma and chest tube placement.
     
     COMMENTS: A single supine AP radiograph was reviewed and compared to the AP
     chest radiograph from 1 hour prior on [**2836-8-7**].
     
     The tip of an endotracheal tube is seen terminating in the right main
     bronchus.  The left lung is collapsed and the heart and mediastinum are
     shifted to the left.  A large (approximately 50%) right tension pneumothorax
     is identified.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the neck
     bilaterally and in the left chest wall.  A left basilar chest tube remains
     unchanged in position.  A nasogastric tube courses towards the stomach and out
     of view. There are multiple left-sided rib fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Endotracheal tube malpositioned in the right main stem bronchus.
     2)  Large right tension pneumothorax.
     3)  Extensive subcutaneous air.  Please note, the side port on the chest tube
     is located in the soft subcutaneous tissues. Consider re-positioning the tube
     for optimal position.
