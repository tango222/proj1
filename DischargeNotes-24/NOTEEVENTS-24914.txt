Admission Date: [**2778-5-21**]     Discharge Date: [**2778-5-24**]
 
Date of Birth:  [**2705-7-16**]     Sex:  M
 
Service: 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
white male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
originally diagnosed in [**2773-10-10**].  He recently
travels from [**State 176**] to [**Location (un) 695**] area for evaluation by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] regarding possible enrollment in a clinical
trial.  However, he was felt not to be a candidate for the
trial.  He was treated with high-dose Solu-Medrol on [**2778-5-18**]
and [**2778-5-19**] on outpatient setting in hopes of temporization
of the disease so that they could safely return to the
[**State 176**] into the care of his primary Oncologist.

However, on the day prior to admission, he had sudden onset
of dizziness, graying, and blurring of his vision, and
lightheadedness along with some evidence of shortness of
breath and pleuritic chest pain.  He called 911 and was
brought in by ambulance to the [**Hospital1 73**] Emergency Department.  His symptoms were transient.
In the Emergency Department vital signs were, temperature
98.4, blood pressure 80/40, heart rate 70, and oxygen
saturation 99 percent on room air.  In Emergency Department,
he reported that his voice was higher pitched than usual and
he noted increased nonproductive cough.  He also complained
of increased left-sided neck pain.  His neck pain resolved
without an intervention approximately 20 minutes after his
arrival.  He denied any nausea, vomiting, palpitations,
fevers, chills, abdominal pain, hemoptysis, dysphagia, throat
pain, wheeze, or stridor.

In the Emergency Department, ultrasound showed a nonocclusive
thrombus in the right common femoral vein.  CT scan of the
neck demonstrated a large lymphoma approximately 12.2 x 8 cm
with the left carotid arteries patent by encased by tumor.
He was seen in consultation by the ENT Service, who noted the
larynx and trachea deviated to the right, but no other
deviation of his anatomy.  Given the rapid increase in size
of the mass, he was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for further monitoring of concern for possible airway
compromise.  He was also seen by the Vascular Surgery
Service, who recommended a carotid ultrasound.  Prior to
leaving the Emergency Department, he received allopurinol 300
mg p.o. x 1, Decadron 40 mg p.o. x 1, and Anzemet.  He was
monitored over night in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and
was then discharged to the Pulmonary Transplant Unit.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denied fevers, chills, recurrent chest
pain, stridor, wheezing, cough, or hemoptysis.  He denied any
changes in appetite, weight, or night sweats.  No nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis, constipation, dysphagia, or
odynophagia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-
cell type, diagnosed in [**2773-10-10**], status post  R-CHOP,
and XRT to the groin in [**2777-9-9**], status post DHAP in
8, 2003.  He is status post repeat cycles of R-CHOP in
[**11/2773**] and through 02/2000.  Status post treatment with
Taxol, topotecan, and Rituxan from [**1-/2776**] to 04/2002.
Status post treatment with Rituxan and gemcitabine in [**5-/2777**]
to 07/2003.  Status post repeat treatment with DHAP in
[**2778-3-31**] to [**2778-4-3**].  Status post two cycles of Rituxan
in [**2778-4-10**].  History of DVT and PE status post six weeks
of Coumadin therapy, originally diagnosed in [**2778-2-9**].
Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times four vessels
in [**2770**].  Status post transurethral resection of prostate.
History of shingles.

ALLERGIES:  The patient was allergic to ciprofloxacin
resulting in hives, Vicodin resulting in dehydration, and
Humibid resulting in hives.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Multivitamin one p.o. q.d.
5. Vitamin D.
6. Calcium carbonate.
7. Of note, he recently finished the course of Coumadin.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife in [**State 176**].
He is a former tobacco smoker, but quit 25 years prior to
admission.  Denies any alcohol or IV drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon transfer:  Generally, he is a
well-developed, well-nourished elderly male, breathing
comfortably in no acute distress.  Head, neck exam was
remarkable for normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular eye
movements were intact.  Sclerae anicteric.  Oral mucosa
moist.  No oropharyngeal lesions.  Neck exam remarkable for a
large left-sided neck mass, thick 12 X 10 cm with deviation
in the trachea to the right.  Pulmonary exam showed lungs to
be clear to auscultation bilaterally no adventitious breath
sounds.  The patient also had a well-healed median sternotomy
scar.  Cardiovascular exam was regular, rate, and rhythm and
normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, rubs, and gallops.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended with positive normal bowel
sounds.  There is no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities exam showed bilateral lower extremity edema of
right greater than left.  Distal pulses were full.
Extremities were warm and well perfused.  Neurological exam
show cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  The patient
is alert and oriented x 3.

PERTINENT LABS:  X-rays and other studies on transfer to the
Pulmonary Transplant Service, the patient had a white blood
cell count with a WBC of 8.0 with 62 percent neutrophils, 28
percent lymphocytes, 9 percent monocytes, 0.2 percent
eosinophils, 0.2 percent basophils, hematocrit 35.6, and
platelets 210,000.  Coagulations were also PT 14.4, PTT 87.9,
and INR 1.4.  Serum chemistry showed sodium 138, potassium
4.2, chloride 102, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8,
glucose 156, calcium 8.8, phosphorus 3.0, magnesium 1.9, and
uric acid 3.1.  Three sets of cardiac enzymes were
unremarkable.  LDH elevated at 341.  Digoxin is 0.8.
Antibody typing screen was negative.  Urinalysis negative.
Imaging showed a chest x-ray with cardiac size slightly
enlarged.  There was slight elevation of left hemidiaphragm
with discoid atelectasis at the left base.  There was a left-
sided Port-A-Cath tip that was present but difficult to
distinguish.  A CT scan of the head without contrast
demonstrated no acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of
major vascular territorial infarct.  The patient was noted to
have very prominent basilar artery.  CT of the neck
demonstrated a large left-sided mass approximately 12.2 x 8.4
cm.  There was marked right tracheal displacement with
questionable intraluminal tracheal mass.  The tumor encased
the left common carotid but flow appeared patent.  CT of the
chest demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  There
were noted a 10 mm precarinal node.  As well, there were also
emphysematous changes at the lung bases.  There were two
right-sided upper lobe pulmonary nodules, the largest 6 mm in
diameter.  Lower extremity ultrasound showed no flow in the
right popliteal secondary to nonocclusive thrombus.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Large B-cell lymphoma with
the left neck mass.  The patient received IV Decadron and
Anzemet in the Emergency Department for preparation of the
second cycle of DHAP, which consisted of Decadron,
cytarabine, and cisplatin.  He received a total four days of
therapy.  This will be completed with vigorous hydration,
allopurinol, and serial checks of tumor lysis labs.  He was
supported with blood products.  On this regimen, the size of
his neck mass was decreased.  He was felt stable for
discharge and travel back to [**State 176**] and with resume care
with his primary Oncologist there.  It was reiterated to the
patient several times that at this time he was not a
candidate for moment in clinical trial regarding treatment
with Zevelin and in light of his rapidly progressive bulky
disease, or he might be never be a candidate for such
treatment.

Deep vein thrombosis.  The patient was started on heparin and
Coumadin when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, it
is unclear if the right deep vein thrombosis was old or new,
I have concern for pulmonary embolus.  As the patient's CT
was negative, he was switched Lovenox and we will continue
this as an outpatient.

Dyspnea:  CT was negative for PE.  The patient ruled out for
MI.  There were no signs or symptoms of airway compromise.
He was followed by the ENT Service while he was inhouse.
After chemotherapy was complete, his neck mass had decreased
in size somewhat.  He remained without evidence of airway
compromise.

Chest pain:  It is unclear that the patient's initial
symptoms were more consistent with transient ischemia versus
vasovagal episode.  His chest pain resolved on the day of
admission.  It was felt to be atypical in character and
unlike his previous coronary chest pain prior to his CABG, it
was felt to be less likely to be ischemic in nature.
Additionally, he ruled out for myocardial infarction.  Two
sets of negative enzymes and his EKG remained unchanged.  He
was instructed to continue digoxin and Lopressor.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Afebrile.  Hemodynamically
stable.  No chest pain.  No shortness of breath.  Tolerating
well intake without nausea or vomiting.  Ambulating
independently.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.
Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
History of pulmonary embolus.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
grafting.
Status post transurethral resection of the prostate.
History of shingles.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Compazine 10 mg p.o. q.4-6 hours as needed for nausea.
2. Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. a.c. and h.s.
3. Decadron 20 mg p.o. q.d.  

FOLLOWUP PLAN:  The patient was instructed to call his
primary Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6323**], for followup appointment
upon returning from [**State 176**].

     INDICATIONS:  Swollen right leg, history of prior right-sided DVT.
     
     BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND:  Using a linear probe, [**Doctor Last Name 66**] scale
     and color Doppler sonograms of both common femoral, superficial femoral, and
     popliteal vessels was performed.  Within the right common femoral vein, flow
     is seen within the central portion of the vein with thrombus located
     peripherally.  Valsalva shows slight reduction in flow, but there is little
     respiratory variability, suggestive of obstruction more proximally.  A very
     small amount of flow is seen in the right superficial femoral vein.  Neither
     of these vessels compress completely. No flow is seen within the right
     popliteal vein. The left system demonstrates no intraluminal thrombus.  The
     vessels demonstrate normal flow, compressibility, respiratory variability, and
     augmentation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No flow seen in right popliteal vein, and nonocclusive thrombus seen in
     right superficial femoral and common femoral veins.  The eccentric location of
     the clot likely makes this chronic clot with recanalization. 
     2. Lack of respiratory variability in right common femoral vein, a finding
     suspicous for obstruction to flow more proximally.
     3. The left system is patent without DVT.

     INDICATION:  Lymphoma per history, with large left-sided neck mass, now with
     chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness and blurry vision.  Evaluate for
     pulmonary embolus or obstruction of blood flow intracranially.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest and neck were acquired helically before
     and after administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.  Contrast imaging
     initially acquired of the lungs, followed by CT angiography imaging of the
     carotid arteries, in the appropriate arterial phase.  Multiplanar reformations
     were made.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The pulmonary vasculature is well opacified
     and demonstrates no intraluminal filling defects suggestive of pulmonary
     emboli.  No pathologically-enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are seen.
     There is a single borderline enlarged precarinal lymph node which measures 10
     mm in short axis.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.  Evaluation
     of lung parenchyma is somewhat limited secondary to respiratory motion.  There
     are some emphysematous changes in the lung bases, with areas of dependent
     atelectasis.  Two right-sided upper lobe pulmonary nodules are present, the
     larger of which measures 6 mm in greatest dimension.  Degenerative changes are
     seen throughout the spine.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions
     are identified.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK:  There is a large left-sided neck mass, which
     measures 12.2 x 8.4 cm in greatest axial dimensions.  This mass extends
     inferiorly substernally, and causes marked rightward tracheal displacement.
     Furthermore, on one of the images (series 3B, image 209), there is a focal
     soft tissue density within the tracheal lumen suggestive of intraluminal mass.
     The mass also appears intimately associated with the left lobe of the thyroid,
     although it does not enhance to the same degree as the remaining thyroid
     tissue.  The mass completely encases the left common carotid artery along
     virtually its entire course.  At the level of the bifurcation, there is no
                                                                 (Over)

     residual mass.  The left internal carotid maintains vigorous flow, and while
     minimally narrowed, the overall caliber remains similar to the right common
     carotid artery.  There is no obstruction of intracranial flow.  Note is made
     of a very prominent basilar artery, although no focal aneurysmal dilatation is
     seen.  There is a right-sided jugulodigastric cervical lymph node, which
     measures 11 mm in short axis.  Degenerative changes are seen in the cervical
     spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Large left-sided neck mass with extensive rightward tracheal deviation.
     The mass encases but does not obstruct the left common carotid artery, along
     its entire course. The mass extends substernally to the level of the aortic
     arch. A right sided 11mm jugulodigastric lymph node is seen.
     3.  small mass within the trachea.
     4. Patent internal carotid arteries and basilar artery bilaterally. The
     basilar artery is enlarged without focal aneurysmal dilatation.
     5.  Single prominent pretracheal lymph node which does not meet CT criteria
     for pathological enlargement by CT scan.
     6.  Two right upper lobe pulmonary nodules, the largest of which is 6 mm.
     Continued followup of these lesions is recommended. Comparison with prior
     studies would be helpful.

     WET READ AUDIT #1 EEZ SUN [**2778-5-21**] 4:22 PM
      no PE. Huge left anterior neck mass (12cm) with leftward rightward tracheal
      deviation and probable mass within trachea. Left common carotid encased by
      mass but remains patent, with no evidence of obstruction of intracranial flow.

                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     INDICATION:  Lymphoma per history, with large left-sided neck mass, now with
     chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness and blurry vision.  Evaluate for
     pulmonary embolus or obstruction of blood flow intracranially.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest and neck were acquired helically before
     and after administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.  Contrast imaging
     initially acquired of the lungs, followed by CT angiography imaging of the
     carotid arteries, in the appropriate arterial phase.  Multiplanar reformations
     were made.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The pulmonary vasculature is well opacified
     and demonstrates no intraluminal filling defects suggestive of pulmonary
     emboli.  No pathologically-enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are seen.
     There is a single borderline enlarged precarinal lymph node which measures 10
     mm in short axis.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.  Evaluation
     of lung parenchyma is somewhat limited secondary to respiratory motion.  There
     are some emphysematous changes in the lung bases, with areas of dependent
     atelectasis.  Two right-sided upper lobe pulmonary nodules are present, the
     larger of which measures 6 mm in greatest dimension.  Degenerative changes are
     seen throughout the spine.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions
     are identified.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK:  There is a large left-sided neck mass, which
     measures 12.2 x 8.4 cm in greatest axial dimensions.  This mass extends
     inferiorly substernally, and causes marked rightward tracheal displacement.
     Furthermore, on one of the images (series 3B, image 209), there is a focal
     soft tissue density within the tracheal lumen suggestive of intraluminal mass.
     The mass also appears intimately associated with the left lobe of the thyroid,
     although it does not enhance to the same degree as the remaining thyroid
     tissue.  The mass completely encases the left common carotid artery along
     virtually its entire course.  At the level of the bifurcation, there is no
                                                                 (Over)

     residual mass.  The left internal carotid maintains vigorous flow, and while
     minimally narrowed, the overall caliber remains similar to the right common
     carotid artery.  There is no obstruction of intracranial flow.  Note is made
     of a very prominent basilar artery, although no focal aneurysmal dilatation is
     seen.  There is a right-sided jugulodigastric cervical lymph node, which
     measures 11 mm in short axis.  Degenerative changes are seen in the cervical
     spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Large left-sided neck mass with extensive rightward tracheal deviation.
     The mass encases but does not obstruct the left common carotid artery, along
     its entire course. The mass extends substernally to the level of the aortic
     arch. A right sided 11mm jugulodigastric lymph node is seen.
     3.  small mass within the trachea.
     4. Patent internal carotid arteries and basilar artery bilaterally. The
     basilar artery is enlarged without focal aneurysmal dilatation.
     5.  Single prominent pretracheal lymph node which does not meet CT criteria
     for pathological enlargement by CT scan.
     6.  Two right upper lobe pulmonary nodules, the largest of which is 6 mm.
     Continued followup of these lesions is recommended. Comparison with prior
     studies would be helpful.
