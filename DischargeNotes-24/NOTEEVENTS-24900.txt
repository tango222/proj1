History of Present Illness:
49 yo M with a history of ESRD, secondary to kidney transplant 
failure who was transferred from [**Hospital 770**] Hospital for suspected 
TTP-HUS. The patient reports that he has had six months of 
increasing shortness of breath, fatigue and intermittent 
blood-tinged productive cough. The shortness of breath has 
become acutely worse over the last few days and he has had 
symptoms of orthopnea. 
.
The patient presented to the OSH and was noted to have bilateral 
pleural effusions on chest CT, Hct 20.5, K 7.8 Cr 4.2 and 
glucose > 400. He received several boluses of insulin and was 
placed on an insulin gtt. He was also given an amp of D50, 
calcium chloride, and kayexalate with subsequent decrease in K 
to 5.9. He receieved 2 units of PRBCs which bumped his Hct to 
24.7. He was placed on 4L NC for decreased O2 sat. Hematology 
was consulted and felt that he needed plasmapheresis for 
hemolytic uremic syndrome. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 25**] for 
further management.

Pertinent Results:
OSH RECORDS: 
[**2547-11-24**] CHEST CT: CHF, RLL infiltrate
[**2547-11-22**] BNP 896, Rheumatoid factor 17 (0-13)
[**2547-11-3**] PFTs: FVC moderately reduce, FEV1 mildly to moderately 
reduced/ FEV1/FVC = normal, TLC moderately reduced. Diffusion 
severely reduced. Moderate restrictive disease w/ severe 
reduction in diffusion capacity. 
[**2547-11-3**] ECHO: EF 60-65%, mild concentric LVH, oderate biatrial 
enlargement; mildr tricuspid and trace pulmonic regurgitation.
.
Renal transplant u/s: No hydronephrosis. Normal vascularity 
throughout the transplanted renal parenchyma.
.
Bronchial washings [**12-2**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Reactive 
bronchial epithelial cells, pulmonary macrophages, lymphocytes 
and neutrophils. 
.
CT chest: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis 
involving large portions of both lower lobes. The possibility of 
superimposed consolidation (reflecting pneumonia or aspiration) 
is difficult to exclude.
2. Ascites and subcutaneous edema, consistent with diffuse third 
spacing of fluid.
3. Small amount of hyperdense material within the gallbladder, 
which may represent stones or sludge.
4. Tubes and lines positioned as described.
5. Three rounded soft tissue density structures between 
posterior ribs near the spine as described, which may represent 
lymph[**MD Number 298**]. 

TTE: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular  
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall 
left  
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber  size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately  thickened. There is mild 
to moderate aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic  regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild  
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic  hypertension. There is a trivialpericardial 
effusion. 
.
Bone Marrow biopsy: Peripheral blood granulocytic dysplasia, 
along with dysplasia of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages in 
the bone marrow aspirate raises the possibility of 
myelodysplastic syndrome.  Blasts (peripheral blood and marrow) 
were enumerated at <1%.  Ringed sideroblasts were not 
identified.  In the absence of myelotoxic or myelo-stimulatory 
therapy, the findings are suspicious for refractory cytopenia 
with multi-lineage dysplasia (RCMD) in the WHO classification.  
However, we note that the patient is critically ill, has end 
stage renal disease and is under several medications.  Clinical, 
pharmaco-therapeutic list and cytogenetic correlation is 
recommended.  We further recommend a repeat biopsy for 
confirmation and evaluation for definitive diagnosis.
.
Bronchial washings [**12-8**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Reactive 
pulmonary macrophages and scattered yeast forms some of which 
appear to be within cells. 
.
R UE u/s: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
.
TEE [**12-25**]:
1 The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color  
Doppler.  
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.  
3.The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are 
normal in  
diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.  
4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses 
or vegetations  
are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or 
vegetation is  
seen on the mitral valve. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is 
seen (within  
normal limits).  
6.There is no pericardial effusion.  
.
CT torso: 
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Again seen are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions 
with associated atelectasis. There is also some ascites.

transplanted kidney in the left lower quadrant. No 
hydronephrosis. Normal vascularity of the transplanted kidney.
.
transplant biopsy:
1.  Chronic allograft nephropathy.
2.  Diabetic nephropathy.
3.  Changes consistent with ""acute tubular necrosis"", see note.
.
Repeat TEE [**1-3**]: 
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast 
or thrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial 
appendage or the body of the  right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying  velocity is 
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or  
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness abnd cavity size 
are normal.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. There is a  focal simple atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve  leaflets are moderately 
thickened. Mild-moderate aortic stenosis is suggested (not 
quantified). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There  is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo M w/ ESRD s/p kidney transplant on chronic 
immunosuppressive therapy, presenting with AMS, 
thrombocytopenia, ARF, hemolytic anemia and pancytopenia, and 
respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, with 
MDS on BM bx and persistent fevers of unknown origin, now on HD. 

.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure/pulmonary edema: likely secondary 
to volume overload in setting of ESRD +/- possible Ventilator 
associated pneumonia.  EF by [**2547-12-4**] TTE was normal at 60% so 
CHF unlikely contributor. Cultures revealed no growth and he 
completed a 7 day course of zosyn/vancomycin for possible 
ventilator associated pneumonia. He had some difficulty weaning 
off of PEEP believed to be secondary to volume overload in the 
setting of renal failure and his HD was increased to QD. 
Following increased HD, he was able to be switched to pressure 
support on the ventilator and sedation was weaned.  He was 
extubated on [**2547-12-20**].  However, he failed extubation after 2 
hours with tachypnea and low tidal volumes and was reintubated. 
He underwent trach and PEG without complication.  He was slowly 
able to be weaned off the vent with gradual return of 
respiratory muscle strength.   Prior to discharge he had no 
mechanical ventilation requirements and was maintained on trach 
mask alone. 
.
# Fever: Patient had been spiking fevers as high as 102 in the 
ICU. He had a thorough work up for infection with all culture 
and serology negative except for a weakly positive IgM for 
Ehrlichia at IgM Ab + 1:80 titer. Further studies were sent and 
he was started on doxycycline for presumed Ehrlichia infection.  
Urine, blood, stool, respiratory cultures remained negative 
except for some yeast which grew from BAL and sputum cultures.  
Because of persistent fevers his temporary dialysis catheter as 
well as his PICC were pulled and tip cultures were negative.  
CMV serologies and viral load were drawn initially and were 
negative.  They were then resent because of persistent fevers 
and were again negative.  BK virus, cryptococcal Ag, and Babesia 
PCR were also drawn. BK virus was strongly positive in the urine 
but was negative in the serum suggesting renal transplant 
colonization.  Cryptococcus and Babesia were negative. LP was 
negative for infection.  TEE was negative for valve vegetation. 
He completed a 7 day course of vancomycin/zosyn for possible 
ventilator associated pneumonia.  Following discontinuation of 
broad spectrum antibiotics, he remained afebrile on only 
doxycycline for presumed Ehrlichia infection. He completed a 14 
day course of doxycycline and then again spiked a fever with 
associated hypotension.  He was restarted on vancomycin and 
zosyn as well as stress dose steroids with concern for sepsis.  
His hypotension responded to fluid boluses.  Blood cultures grew 
coag negative staph in 1/6 blood culture bottles and his Zosyn 
was d/c'ed.  His fevers rapidly recovered as did his mental 
status.  He completed a 7 day course of vancomycin and was then 
off all antibiotics.  His steroids were tapered to baseline 
required for immunosuppresion for his renal transplant. A renal 
biopsy did not suggest transplant rejection as a cause of 
fevers. He also received a CT abdomen to evaluate for 
intrabdominal abscess, lymphoma, or other malignancy which was 
negative. There was no clear cause of his intermittent fevers 
throughout admission. However, at the time of discharge, patient 
had been afebrile off of all antibiotics.
.
# Pancytopenia: There was evidence of hemolytic anemia based on 
admission Hct, haptoglobin, and peripheral smear. However, per 
heme/onc and transfusion medicine, there were only few 
schistocytes on peripheral smear and was not believed to be 
consistent with TTP-HUS. A Direct Coombs was negative. There was 
initially some concern that anemia could have been due to 
Cyclosporin and it was stopped. However, bone marrow biopsy was 
obtained and was suggestive of MDS and cyclosporin was 
restarted. He received a total of 6 units PRBCs over the course 
of admission as well as 5 units of platelets. Following 
cyclosporin restart, cell lines remained stable. He required no 
further transfusions after [**12-11**]. Parvovirus DNA and Ehrlichia 
serologies were drawn as above to work up possible contribution 
and Ehrlichia was only weakly positive.  However, he still 
completed a full course of doxycycline.  His counts all 
rebounded to normal values at the time of discharge. Hematology 
Oncology recommended outpatient follow up to determine whether 
he required any further evaluation or treatment for possible 
MDS. 
.
# Acute on CRI - s/p renal transplant.  Patient has been on 
chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Outside transplant physician 
had been increasing doses of cyclosporin over past several 
months. Cyclosporine level was 89 on admission but concern for 
contribution to pancytopenia and was stopped as above.  
Cyclosporin held briefly given concern that it was 
causing/contributing to pancytopenia, but restarted once bone 
marrow bx suggestive of MDS. Levels were followed and have 
remained low since restart with goal level ~75. However, levels 
never reached goal.  He received a biopsy of his transplant 
kidney which showed no evidence of acute rejection.  It was 
thought that his acute renal failure was most likely secondary 
to ATN.  Due to this, his cyclosporin was stopped given risk for 
renal vasoconstriction.  Immunosuppression was maintained with 
prednisone and cellcept. He was initially managed with triweekly 
dialysis which was increased to daily dialysis to help improve 
respiratory status.  His urine output eventually began to 
improve and his dialysis was again decreased to ~ 3 times a week 
as needed.  He was initially dialyzed through his fistula.  
However, this clotted off and could not be opened by 
interventional radiology.  Therefore, prior to discharge, he 
received a tunneled Quinton line for further dialysis after 
discharge while his ATN continued to resolve. He should have 24 
hour urine studies checked intermittently to determine need for 
further dialysis. 
.
# Hypertension - Patient had been resistant to multiple 
medications as outpatient previously. Prior to initiation of 
daily dialysis, patient was also extremely hypertensive on the 
floor. Possibly secondary to steroids, although required high 
dose of beta blocker as outpatient. He was initially managed 
with diltiazem, nifedipine, labetolol, and hydralazine.  Blood 
pressures improved with initiation of daily dialysis and he 
blood pressure medications were cut back.  Following a 
hypotensive episode as described above, his BP medications were 
stopped.  Eventually he was restarted on labetolol with 
hydralazine as needed with good blood pressure control. 
Diltiazem was also added for atrial fibrillation as described 
below. 
.
# Atrial fibrillation - He was initially found to be in Atrial 
fibrillation on admission believed to be most likely secondary 
to adrenergic surge in the setting of sepsis. However, he 
quickly returned to NSR.  However, towards the end of his 
admission, he once again converted to Afib with RVR which 
required a diltiazem drip for adequate rate control.  He was 
eventually transitioned to po diltiazem in addition to his 
labetolol with good heart rate control. He did  not convert 
spontaneously and was started on a heparin drip for 
anticoagulation.  He then had a repeat TEE which verified that 
he had no clots in his atria.  EP then recommended chemical 
cardioversion as they felt he would be high risk of reverting to 
Afib in the setting of acute illness. He was therefore loaded 
with 6 grams of amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg po BID. Following 
this loading dose he was decreased to 200 mg po BID which was 
set to be continued for 1 months time.  His HRs were monitored 
with the start of amiodarone to determine the need for diltiazem 
weaning as the amiodarone took effect. He was also started on 
coumadin for transition off of heparin drip. 
.
# Diabetes. - Patient was started on hydrocortisone for 
immunosuppression and had significant elevation in his blood 
sugars. Also believed to be some contribution of possible 
infection.  He required high doses of insulin sliding scale and 
was started on lantus which was uptitrated as high as 34 units 
QD.  However, following resolution of his fevers, he had some 
episodes of hypoglycemia and his insulin was cut back.  With 
return of his fevers and initiation of stress dose steroids in 
the setting of hypotension, his blood sugars once again elevated 
rapidly and he was started on an insulin drip.  The drip was 
continued until his steroids were weaned back down to his 
maintenance dose for immunosuppression for his renal transplant. 
He was then converted to a subQ regimen.
.
# Diarrhea: Patient had a significant amount of diarrhea 
throughout his ICU stay. Stool studies were all negative 
including cultures and C diff toxin A and B were negative 
throughout admission.  Banana flakes were added to be given in 
between tube feeds with some improvement in diarrhea. 
.
# FEN - Nutren Renal 3/4 strength; Additives: Beneprotein, 45 
gm/day, Banana flakes, 3 packets per day. Goal: 40 ml/hr
.
# PPX - SC heparin followed by heparin drip followed by 
coumadin. Pneumoboots. Lansoprazole while on steroids.

Respiratory Care:
Patient received from OSH for increased SOB and WOB, secondary to ARF and anemia.  Intubated electively for treatment of acute hypercarbia and increasing secretions.  Placed on ventilatory support (A/C, 500 X 18 X 100%, 5 PEEP).  Increased rr to 24 due to low pH value and titrated FIO2 to 50%, based on SPO2.  ABg results allowed the FIO2 to be lowered to 40%, but the PCO2 required an increase in VT to 550 ml.  Latest abg results determined a metabolic acidemia with very good oxygenation on the current settings.

No RSBI measured due to airway protection requirements and the need to assist in the ventilatory efforts for effective CO2 clearance.

NPN Addendum

Pt went into bursts of what looked like afib to the 130s with short periods of NSR.  His K was 3.5 - he was given 40 meq PO.  His HR went up to the 170s, EKG was afib with a bundle per the team, he was given 20 mg of IV lobetolol without effect.  He was then given 10 mg of IV dilt x2 which brought his HR down to the 130s-140s and he was started on a labetolol gtt.  The team has not been able to get an aline in - it was tried last night as well without success, we are only able to use his R forearm and thigh to get an NBP as he has a fistula on the L and a PIC on the R.

     HISTORY:  Followup infiltrate.  Reference exam [**12-3**] at 0057
     
     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube
     tip is in the stomach.  The right IJ line tip is in the SVC/RA junction. 
     There continue to be bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with
     dense retrocardiac opacity likely representing volume
     loss/infiltrate/effusion.  There is increased opacity in the right lower lung
     that also likely represents effusion and volume loss.  The vasculature
     continues to be hazy and indistinct consistent with pulmonary edema.  Compared
     to the film from earlier the same day, the vasculature is more indistinct and
     the heart is enlarged suggesting increased CHF.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Immunosuppressed male with question of left retrocardiac
     infiltrate.  Evidence of lingular infiltrate with bloody mucous.  Please
     evaluate.  History of renal transplant with elevated creatinine.
     
     Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs in the last several
     days.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained without IV
     contrast.  IV contrast could not be administered due to the patient's elevated
     creatinine and history of renal transplant.  Coronal reformatted images were
     generated.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  An endotracheal tube is in place, with the
     tip near the thoracic inlet.  A nasogastric tube is in place, terminating
     within the stomach.  There is a right internal jugular central venous catheter
     in place, with the tip at the cavoatrial junction.  A right PICC catheter is
     also in place, with the tip at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no
     pneumothorax.
     
     There are heavy coronary artery calcifications.  There is no pericardial
     effusion.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and
     moderate on the left, simple in nature.  There is associated atelectasis
     bilaterally.  As noted on prior chest radiographs, there is near complete
     opacification of the left lower lobe.  There is also some opacification of the
     posterior lingula.  These opacities likely reflect volume loss, possibly with
     superimposed consolidation related to aspiration or pneumonia. Tiny areas of
     hyperdensity in the left lower lobe may reflect tiny foci of mucus impaction
     or hemorrhage. Air bronchograms are noted in both lower lobes.
     
     Respiratory motion limits detail in the aerated portions of the lungs.  The
     vascular structures appear prominent, suggesting some component of congestive
     failure or fluid overload.
     
     There are small scattered axillary lymph nodes, greater on the left, though
     none meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There are no definite
     pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar nodes.

     (Cont)
     there is a rounded soft tissue density structure measuring 12 x 8 mm.  Similar
     rounded soft tissue densities are seen in similar locations more superiorly,
     between the right and left sixth and seventh ribs.
     
     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the visualized portion of the
     liver, spleen, splenule, pancreas and adrenal glands are normal, within the
     limits of a non-contrast-enhanced CT.  A small amount of hyperdense material
     is seen layering dependently within an otherwise unremarkable gallbladder.
     This hyperdense material could represent small stones or sludge.  There is a
     small amount of ascites fluid surrounding the liver and within the left mid
     abdomen, associated with nondilated small bowel loops.  There is stranding of
     the subcutaneous fat of both flanks, suggesting third spacing of fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     Coronal reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis involving large portions of
     both lower lobes. The possibility of superimposed consolidation (reflecting
     pneumonia or aspiration) is difficult to exclude.
     
     2.  Ascites and subcutaneous edema, consistent with diffuse third spacing of
     fluid.
     
     3.  Small amount of hyperdense material within the gallbladder, which may
     represent stones or sludge.
     
     4.  Tubes and lines positioned as described.
     
     5.  Three rounded soft tissue density structures between posterior ribs near
     the spine as described, which may represent lymph nodes.

Neuro:  Pt remains sedated o fent and versed, these were shut of for 1.5 hrs when the team thought that they might extubate him; they are now back on.  He is lightly sedate, following commands, nodding yes and no to questions.

CV:  He has been hypertensive all day - 170s-180s/70s, his labetalol was increased to 1000mg TID with no effect, his hydralazine was increased to 75 mg q6hrs, he was given 20mg of IV dilt and this did (as it has in the past) decreased his SBP to the 150s, his PO dilt is now 90 mg QID.  His CVP was 20 this morning up from 15 yesterday.

Resp:  LS sound diminished in the bases, occationally coarse in the apeces.  He was put on a spontaneous breathing trial and he was acidotic after 30 min with an ABG of 7.25/52/84.  He was put back on A/C and his sedation was turned back on.  The team will try again tomorrow - his tube feeds need to be shut off at 4 am.

GI:  Still having loose stool, conts on TF now with low residuals, conts of reglan.  His abd is soft and distended.  As above, TF should be shut off at 4 am for spontaneous breathing trial.

GU:  U/O so so, given 120mg of IV lasix, putting out 100-140cc/hr, he has scrotal edema and angioadema.  His creat was 2.4 this morning.

Heme:  Conts to be pancytopenic, per the ICU attending he talked to the hema attending yesterda who did feel that this was TTP, he may well need a bone marrow bx but this should be done after extubation when he is more stable and would be able to receive treatment if needed.

Endo:  Remains on a insulin gtt, his BS have been much more stable today.

Soc:  His mother called today, his uncle visited.

     Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2547-12-5**].
     
     The ET tube tip is at least 1.2 cm above the carina, but the carina itself is
     obscured by external devices the precise evaluation of the distance between

     is in low SVC.  The NG tube tip terminates in the stomach.
     
     The heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  There is little improvement in
     pulmonary edema which is still at least moderate degree.  Bilateral pleural
     effusion and left retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged.

     transplant, intubated with a hematocrit drop after thrombocytopenia, evaluate
     for retroperitoneal bleed.
     
     COMPARISON:  12/1706.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the pubic symphysis.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CONTRAST:  No oral or intravenous contrast was administered.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  There is an ET tube with the tip positioned above the
     carina.  An NG tube is seen within the stomach.  There is a right PICC, with
     the tip in the lower SVC.  There is also a right IJ central line, with the tip
     in the SVC.
     
     Soft tissue window images demonstrate several small mediastinal lymph nodes,
     which do not demonstrate pathological enlargement.  Multiple small axillary
     lymph nodes are also noted, which do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
     There is limited evaluation of major vascular structures without intravenous
     contrast, however the aorta demonstrates normal caliber.  Coronary artery
     calcification is seen.  There are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions
     with associated compressive atelectasis.  The remainder of the lung parenchyma
     is well aerated.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Tiny densities are seen within the
     gallbladder, which may represent contrast or tiny stones.  There is ascitic
     fluid around the liver, tracking in the paracolic gutters.  There is limited
     evaluation without intravenous contrast, however the liver, spleen, pancreas,
     and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The spleen is enlarged measuring 16 cm.
     The patient has bilateral nephrectomies.  No pathologically enlarged
     retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is identified.  There is no
     evidence of retroperitoneal or extraperitoneal fluid.  Ascites is noted in the
     soft tissues of the flanks.  There is limited evaluation of bowel without oral
     or intravenous contrast, however there is no evidence of bowel dilatation.  No
     free intraperitoneal air is seen.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  49-year-old man with renal failure and acidemia with a renal
     transplant, intubated with a hematocrit drop after thrombocytopenia, evaluate
     for retroperitoneal bleed.
     
     COMPARISON:  12/1706.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the pubic symphysis.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CONTRAST:  No oral or intravenous contrast was administered.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  There is an ET tube with the tip positioned above the
     carina.  An NG tube is seen within the stomach.  There is a right PICC, with
     the tip in the lower SVC.  There is also a right IJ central line, with the tip
     in the SVC.
     
     Soft tissue window images demonstrate several small mediastinal lymph nodes,
     which do not demonstrate pathological enlargement.  Multiple small axillary
     lymph nodes are also noted, which do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
     There is limited evaluation of major vascular structures without intravenous
     contrast, however the aorta demonstrates normal caliber.  Coronary artery
     calcification is seen.  There are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions
     with associated compressive atelectasis.  The remainder of the lung parenchyma
     is well aerated.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Tiny densities are seen within the
     gallbladder, which may represent contrast or tiny stones.  There is ascitic
     fluid around the liver, tracking in the paracolic gutters.  There is limited
     evaluation without intravenous contrast, however the liver, spleen, pancreas,
     and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The spleen is enlarged measuring 16 cm.
     The patient has bilateral nephrectomies.  No pathologically enlarged
     retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is identified.  There is no
     evidence of retroperitoneal or extraperitoneal fluid.  Ascites is noted in the
     soft tissues of the flanks.  There is limited evaluation of bowel without oral
     or intravenous contrast, however there is no evidence of bowel dilatation.  No
     free intraperitoneal air is seen.

Neuro:  remains sedated on fent and versed, he has needed many more boluses today than yesterday of both fent and versed.  He is now on 75 mcg/hr of fent and 1.5 mg/hr of versed.  He opens his eyes spontaneously, does not follow commands, but at times appears to understand what I say to him.

CV:  An A line was incerted this afternoon, he has been having frequent APCs and has gone into afib - an EKG was done while he was in this.  He conts on his cardiac meds which he is tolerating.

Resp:  Remains intubated, on A/C 550x20/.[**4-28**], his rate was increased to improve his acidosis  - ABG was 7.27/39/105, his last ABG was 7.36/31/130.  Sx for old looking blood, a sputum was sent today.  LS are improved from yesterday, more clear than coarse, somewhat bronchial on the R.

GI:  Conts on his TF, he is having low residuals, conts to have loose stool, he nodded ""yes"" once [**Last Name (un) 1897**] asked if he needed a bedpan.  ABD is soft and distended, he had a CT of his ABD and pelvis to look at his kidneys.

GU:  His creat increased significantly this morning from yesterday, he is putting out 2-4 cc/hr of urine, a line will be put in in order to dialyse him - this will probably done tomorrow.  An US was done because he has a bruise over his transplanted kidney site on his L abd.  He was given 2 bags of plt prior to his line placement - his repeat plts were 69.  His vanco will be dosed according to his level and his zosyn is now renaly dosed. 

Endo:  His blood sugars have been high, he will need higher long acting dose.

Soc:  His family was in today, concerned, asking appropriate questions.

Neuro:  Pt remains sedated on fent 100mcg/hr and 2 mg/hr of versed, compared with yesterday he is more sedate and comfortable on these doses.  He has required infrequent (twice today) prn boluses of fent and versed for periods of slight aggitation.

CV:  Tolerating his cardiac meds, no afib today, BP 150s-130s/70s-60s, HR 80s SR.  His K as Mg have been repleated.

Resp:  LS coarse on the R clear on the L, diminished in the bases.  His FI02 has been weaned to 40% and his PEEP to 10 - he will need an ABG later today, we are following his 02 SATs  for his oxygenation.  He remains on A/C 550x14/.[**3-27**].

GI:  ABD remains soft and distended, pos BS, tolerating his TF with low residuals.  He has had a small amount of loose stool.

GU:  Almost no urine today - ~ 14cc all day, if he has enough to sent he needs a u/a.  His Na was 136 this morning; his free water boluses have been d/ced.  He was not dialysed today but most likely will be tomorrow.

     The radiograph is of suboptimal quality with the right lateral hemithorax not
     included in the film.  There are bilateral layering moderate pleural
     effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly and CHF is noted.  ET tube is 2 cm from the

Respiratory Care:
Pt is an ESRD with no urine and has been getting dialysis to remove fluid. On A/C as per CareVue. He has periods of desaturation for reasons unknown that corrects itself in about 5-10 minutes during which he needs more oxygen. We are able to back off fairly quickley. I think this may be due to fluid shifts in the lungs ??? Had a good RSBI this AM but he really needs PEEP more than O2. Gets MDI's Q4H. More awake today but too awake and he needed more sedation. Lungs have been fairly clear. Plan: wean meds as tolerated and wean vent if possible...

     Single AP view of the chest is obtained at 12:05 hours and is compared with
     the prior radiograph performed approximately six hours prior.  When compared
     with the prior examination, there is persistence in the cardiac opacity, which
     may have improved.  Persistent small left pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary
     vascular congestion has improved since the prior examination.  The patient
     remains intubated and has a left-sided subclavian line, both of which are in
     satisfactory position.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion and predominantly left-sided
     retrocardiac opacity.  Persistent small left pleural effusion.

     undergoing hemodialysis for volume overload.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2547-12-16**].
     
     AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina.  A
     left subclavian central venous catheter tip is at the junction of the
     brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava.  A nasogastric tube tip
     overlies the proximal stomach.  The cardiac size is grossly stable.  There has
     been an increase in the amount of opacity in both lung bases, but notably in
     the left which likely is due to an increase in pleural fluid in part, although
     consolidation in this region cannot be excluded.  Prominent pulmonary
     vascularity appears slightly more congested than on the prior study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Slightly worsened pulmonary congestion.
     2.  Increased left lower lobe opacity is likely a combination of pleural fluid
     and atelectasis or consolidation.

     EXAMINATION:  AP chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
     
     Single AP view of the chest is obtained at 12:05 hours and is compared with
     the prior radiograph performed approximately six hours prior.  When compared
     with the prior examination, there is persistence in the cardiac opacity, which
     may have improved.  Persistent small left pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary
     vascular congestion has improved since the prior examination.  The patient
     remains intubated and has a left-sided subclavian line, both of which are in
     satisfactory position.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion and predominantly left-sided
     retrocardiac opacity.  Persistent small left pleural effusion.

     for biopsy of the transplanted kidney in the left lower quadrant performed by
     the nephrology service.  The biopsy was performed by the nephrologist, Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7312**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and the attending nephrologist supervising, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7313**].  Four
     passes were performed without complication to obtain adequate sample.  Post-
     biopsy ultrasound demonstrated no hematoma or fluid surrounding the kidney.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful transplant kidney biopsy performed by a nephrologist.

     INDICATION:  49-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, status post
     transplant, persistent fever.  Hypotension.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**]. Intravenous
     contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**] was not administered in this patient with elevated creatinine
     and renal transplant, after the discussion of the referring physician.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso study dated [**2547-12-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CHEST:  The patient is status post tracheostomy, with tracheostomy tube
     terminating just below the thoracic inlet.  There is fluid in the upper
     trachea surrounding the tube.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
     Previously noted bilateral effusion and atelectasis have mostly resolved.
     There is no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Coronary arteries are
     calcified.  Small pericardial effusion is noted.  In the lung window, note is
     made of faint patchy nodular opacities in the lower lobes, which can represent
     small airway infection, however, can be residual opacity given the extensive
     collapse and effusion in the prior study.  No suspicious mass or consolidation
     is noted.  Several nodular opacities are seen in the dependent portion of the
     right lower lobe, which can also be a sequela of prior atelectasis.
     
     ABDOMEN:  The evaluation of major abdominal organs is limited due to lack of
     intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  Liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and the
     visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits.
     Previously noted ascites is not present.  There is possible small
     calcification within the gallbladder without distention or pericholecystic
     fluid.  There is no significant lymphadenopathy.
     
     PELVIS:  There is transplanted kidney in the left lower quadrant, with
     unchanged appearance of the surrounding peritoneal fat, without perinephric
     fluid collection.  There is new 3 mm hypodensity in the renal hilum, which can
     represent tiny hemorrhage or hemorrhagic cyst.  There is no ascites or
     significant lymphadenopathy.  The visualized portion of large and small
     intestines are within normal limits.

     INDICATION:  49-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
     respiratory failure, and fever of unknown origin with need for PICC line.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5393**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**] perform the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**],
     the attending radiologist, was present and supervised throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A preprocedure timeout was performed to verify the
     patient's identity and indication for the procedure.  The patient's right
     upper arm was prepped and draped using sterile technique.  Approximately 2 ml
     of 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic
     guidance the right basilic vein was found to be easily compressible.  Pre and
     post-procedure hardcopy ultrasonographic images were obtained demonstrating
     patency.  Using ultrasonographic guidance, a 21 gauge needle was used to
     access the right basilic vein.  A 0.018 inch guidewire was then advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The needle was exchanged for a 5 French
     micropuncture sheath.  A dual-lumen PICC catheter was trimmed to appropriate
     length of 36 cm.  The PICC catheter was then advanced over the wire into the
     SVC.  The wire and peel-away sheath were removed.  A final fluoroscopic spot
     image of the chest demonstrates tip of the PICC catheter to be in the SVC. The
     catheter was flushed heplocked and statlocked.  The existing right arm PICC
     catheter was removed and the tip sent for culture at the microbiology
     laboratory.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Successful placement of 36 cm right basilic vein dual-lumen PICC catheter
     terminating in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.
     2. Previously placed right upper extremity PICC line was removed and tip sent
     for culture at the microbiology laboratory.

     INDICATION:  49-year-old male with anuric ATN and occluded AV fistula referred
     for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5393**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**],
     the attending radiologist, was present and supervised throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A preprocedure timeout was performed to verify the
     patient's identity and the indication for the procedure.  The patient's right
     neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Using ultrasonographic
     guidance the right internal jugular vein was found to be patent and easily
     compressible.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% lidocaine was used for local
     anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic guidance a 21-gauge needle was advanced
     into the right internal jugular vein.  Hardcopy ultrasound images were
     obtained before and after venous access documenting vessel patency.  A 0.018-
     inch guidewire was introduced and the needle exchanged for a 4 French
     micropuncture sheath.  A 0.035-inch [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire was then introduced via the
     micropuncture sheath under fluoroscopic guidance and advanced into the
     inferior vena cava.  The entrance site was then dilated to accommodate a 12
     French VIP dialysis catheter.  The 16-cm VIP triple-lumen hemodialysis
     catheter was then advanced into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance.
     The wire was removed.  All three lumens of the catheter were flushed, hep
     locked and capped per protocol.  The catheter with then secured to the skin
     using two 2-0 silk sutures.  The skin entrance site was then covered with a
     Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     This procedure was done after AV fistulogram and prior to PICC line placement.
     Moderate sedation was provided throughout the duration of all three procedures
     by administering divided doses of Versed throughout a total intraservice time
     of 1 hour and 45 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters
     were continuously monitored.

     inch guidewire was introduced and the needle exchanged for a 4 French
     micropuncture sheath.  A 0.035-inch [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire was then introduced via the
     micropuncture sheath under fluoroscopic guidance and advanced into the
     inferior vena cava.  The entrance site was then dilated to accommodate a 12
     French VIP dialysis catheter.  The 16-cm VIP triple-lumen hemodialysis
     catheter was then advanced into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance.
     The wire was removed.  All three lumens of the catheter were flushed, hep
     locked and capped per protocol.  The catheter with then secured to the skin
     using two 2-0 silk sutures.  The skin entrance site was then covered with a
     Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     This procedure was done after AV fistulogram and prior to PICC line placement.
     Moderate sedation was provided throughout the duration of all three procedures
     by administering divided doses of Versed throughout a total intraservice time
     of 1 hour and 45 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters
     were continuously monitored.

     INDICATION:  49-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
     respiratory failure, and fever of unknown origin with need for PICC line.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5393**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**] perform the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**],
     the attending radiologist, was present and supervised throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A preprocedure timeout was performed to verify the
     patient's identity and indication for the procedure.  The patient's right
     upper arm was prepped and draped using sterile technique.  Approximately 2 ml
     of 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic
     guidance the right basilic vein was found to be easily compressible.  Pre and
     post-procedure hardcopy ultrasonographic images were obtained demonstrating
     patency.  Using ultrasonographic guidance, a 21 gauge needle was used to
     access the right basilic vein.  A 0.018 inch guidewire was then advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The needle was exchanged for a 5 French
     micropuncture sheath.  A dual-lumen PICC catheter was trimmed to appropriate
     length of 36 cm.  The PICC catheter was then advanced over the wire into the
     SVC.  The wire and peel-away sheath were removed.  A final fluoroscopic spot
     image of the chest demonstrates tip of the PICC catheter to be in the SVC. The
     catheter was flushed heplocked and statlocked.  The existing right arm PICC
     catheter was removed and the tip sent for culture at the microbiology
     laboratory.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Successful placement of 36 cm right basilic vein dual-lumen PICC catheter
     terminating in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.
     2. Previously placed right upper extremity PICC line was removed and tip sent
     for culture at the microbiology laboratory.

     INDICATION:  49-year-old man with clotted AV fistula.
     
     Details of the procedure and possible complications were explained to the
     patient's mother and informed consent was obtained.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**] was performing the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
     arteriovenous fistula on the left forearm was accessed with a micropuncture
     set under direct ultrasound guidance.  A micropuncture sheath was then placed
     over the wire and arteriovenous fistulogram was performed.  There is
     completely clotted proximal radiocephalic fistula with no inflow into the
     fistula.  Some partially occlusive scattered thrombi in the cephalic vein at
     the level of the elbow and humerus.  There is no evidence of central
     obstruction or stenosis.  A micropuncture sheath was then exchanged for a 4-
     French vascular sheath and a 4-French straight catheter was advanced over the
     wire into the central cephalic vein.  A venogram was performed, demonstrating
     widely patent cephalic, subclavian, brachiocephalic veins and SVC.
     
     The findings were discussed with the managing team and it was decided to
     consult Surgery for possible revision of the arterial anastomosis.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Clotted left forearm radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula with no
     evidence of inflow likely due to occlusion at the arterial anastomosis.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  49-year-old male with anuric ATN and occluded AV fistula referred
     for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5393**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**],
     the attending radiologist, was present and supervised throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A preprocedure timeout was performed to verify the
     patient's identity and the indication for the procedure.  The patient's right
     neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Using ultrasonographic
     guidance the right internal jugular vein was found to be patent and easily
     compressible.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% lidocaine was used for local
     anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic guidance a 21-gauge needle was advanced
     into the right internal jugular vein.  Hardcopy ultrasound images were
     obtained before and after venous access documenting vessel patency.  A 0.018-
     inch guidewire was introduced and the needle exchanged for a 4 French
     micropuncture sheath.  A 0.035-inch [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire was then introduced via the
     micropuncture sheath under fluoroscopic guidance and advanced into the
     inferior vena cava.  The entrance site was then dilated to accommodate a 12
     French VIP dialysis catheter.  The 16-cm VIP triple-lumen hemodialysis
     catheter was then advanced into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance.
     The wire was removed.  All three lumens of the catheter were flushed, hep
     locked and capped per protocol.  The catheter with then secured to the skin
     using two 2-0 silk sutures.  The skin entrance site was then covered with a
     Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     This procedure was done after AV fistulogram and prior to PICC line placement.
     Moderate sedation was provided throughout the duration of all three procedures
     by administering divided doses of Versed throughout a total intraservice time
     of 1 hour and 45 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters
     were continuously monitored.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a temporary right internal jugular
                                                                 (Over)

        49 year old man with anuric ATN and clotted AVF - needs HD                    
                                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      place temp HD catheter with VIP port                                            
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  49-year-old male with anuric ATN and occluded AV fistula referred
     for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5393**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**],
     the attending radiologist, was present and supervised throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A preprocedure timeout was performed to verify the
     patient's identity and the indication for the procedure.  The patient's right
     neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Using ultrasonographic
     guidance the right internal jugular vein was found to be patent and easily
     compressible.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% lidocaine was used for local
     anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic guidance a 21-gauge needle was advanced
     into the right internal jugular vein.  Hardcopy ultrasound images were
     obtained before and after venous access documenting vessel patency.  A 0.018-
     inch guidewire was introduced and the needle exchanged for a 4 French
     micropuncture sheath.  A 0.035-inch [**Doctor Last Name 100**] wire was then introduced via the
     micropuncture sheath under fluoroscopic guidance and advanced into the
     inferior vena cava.  The entrance site was then dilated to accommodate a 12
     French VIP dialysis catheter.  The 16-cm VIP triple-lumen hemodialysis
     catheter was then advanced into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance.
     The wire was removed.  All three lumens of the catheter were flushed, hep
     locked and capped per protocol.  The catheter with then secured to the skin
     using two 2-0 silk sutures.  The skin entrance site was then covered with a
     Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     immediate complications.
     
     This procedure was done after AV fistulogram and prior to PICC line placement.
     Moderate sedation was provided throughout the duration of all three procedures
     by administering divided doses of Versed throughout a total intraservice time
     of 1 hour and 45 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters
     were continuously monitored.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a temporary right internal jugular
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  The patient with end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, with
     clotted AV fistula.  Please convert temporary hemodialysis catheter to
     tunneled permanent dialysis catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**] and [**Doctor Last Name **] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**],
     the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Informed consent was obtained.  A preprocedure
     timeout was performed.  The patient was placed supine on the angiography
     table, and the right upper chest and lower neck were prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  An initial fluoroscopic spot image demonstrated the
     indwelling triple lumen hemodialysis catheter tip within the right atrium.  It
     was determined that a catheter length of 23 cm cuff to tip would be suitable.
     
     Attention was turned to the right upper chest, for tunnel preparation.  The
     skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine with
     epinephrine, along the planned tunnel tract.  A small skin incision was made.
     A tunnel was created with a blunt tunneling device.  Next, a J-tipped [**Doctor Last Name 100**]
     wire was advanced through the indwelling temporary hemodialysis catheter into
     the IVC, under fluoroscopic guidance.  The triple lumen catheter was exchanged
     for a 14.5 French vascular sheath.  The inner dilator and wire were removed,
     and the new hemodialysis catheter was advanced through the vascular sheath
     into the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  A final
     fluoroscopic spot image of the chest demonstrates the 14.5-French 23-cm cuff-
     to-tip dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter in place, with the tip in the right
     atrium.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 silk sutures. Dermabond
     was used to close the incision in the lower right neck.  Patient tolerated the
     procedure well, and there were no complications.
     
     Moderate sedation was administered over a total intraservice time of 30
     minutes, during which the patient's hemodynamically parameters were
     continuously monitored.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 14.5-French, 23-cm cuff-to-tip dual-lumen
     tunneled hemodialysis catheter.  The tip of the catheter is within the right
     atrium, and the line is ready for use.

     diameters in centimeters beginning at the wrist and extending proximally are
     as follows:  0.27, 0.42, 0.44, 0.41, 0.10, 0.11 and 0.14.  The basilic vein is
     patent on the right side as well and the diameters beginning just below the
     antecubital fossa extending proximally are as follows in centimeters:  0.52,
     0.72, 0.61.  There is a patent right subclavian vein and there is a patent
     right brachial artery with a triphasic signal.
     
     With respect to the left upper extremity cephalic vein, there is thrombus
     present at the wrist in the left cephalic vein.  The left basilic vein is
     patent and its diameters beginning in the just distal to the antecubital fossa
     and extending proximally in centimeters, they are as follows:  0.82, 0.86 and
     0.64.  The left subclavian vein is patent and the left brachial artery is
     patent with a triphasic signal.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There are patent bilateral subclavian veins and patent bilateral
     brachial arteries.  There is a patent right cephalic vein and patent right and
     left basilic veins.  The left cephalic vein has extensive thrombus at the
     level of the wrist.

        10.7 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest ([**2548-7-23**]);
        33.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2548-7-23**]);
     HISTORY: 50 yo male with NIDDM referred for dyspnea evaluation prior to renal  
     transplant surgery.  
       
       
     SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  
       
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
     mg/kg/min.   
      
     No chest pain or EKG changes during drug infusion.   
       
     METHOD:  
       
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi.  Tracer was
     injected approximately one hour prior to obtaining the resting images.  
       
     Two minutes after the cessation of infusion of dipyridamole, approximately three
     times the resting dose of Tc99m sestamibi was administered IV.  Stress images
     were obtained approximately one hour following tracer injection.  
       
     Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.  
       
     INTERPRETATION:  
       
     Left ventricular cavity size is normal.  
       
     Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the 
     left ventricular myocardium.    
       
     Gated images reveal mild global hypokinesis.  
       
     The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 49 %.    
       
       
     IMPRESSION:  1. Normal myocardial perfusion.  2. Normal LV size with mild global
     hypokinesis; LVEF 49 %.

     HISTORY:  Fever of unknown origin in post-renal transplant patient.
     
     Comparison is made to [**2547-12-27**] CT examination.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the chest,
     abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformations were evaluated.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There has been interval
     development of patchy ground-glass opacities predominantly within the upper
     lobes bilaterally.  No focal consolidations identified.  There are small areas
     of linear and dependent atelectasis noted within the lower lobes bilaterally
     which contain minimal simple pleural effusions (left greater than right) with
     adjacent compression atelectasis.  The airways are patent to the subsegmental
     level.  No pathologically enlarged axillary or central lymphadenopathy is
     identified.  Atherosclerotic disease within the coronary circulation and
     intrathoracic aorta is unchanged.  A right-sided central venous catheter is
     noted.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, stomach,
     intraabdominal bowel, adrenal glands, and pancreas appear unremarkable.  There
     is irregular perfusion/peripheral hypoattenuation within the spleen whose size
     and  supplying vasculature remains prominent. No free air or free fluid is
     noted within the abdominal cavity. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Transplant kidney within the left
     iliac fossa enhances normally.  No active contrast excretion was noted at the
     time of image acquisition.  Mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis, measuring up to
     16 mm is slightly progressed from prior examination and there is a slightly
     atypical enhancement involving the distal collecting system and ureter with
     surrounding inflammation, not significantly changed.  Intrapelvic bowel is
     normal and small amount of air is noted within a Foley containing urinary
     bladder. Incidental note is made of a moderate fat-containing left inguinal
     hernia.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
     Degenerative changes are again noted within the spine and anasarca is noted.
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Nonspecific predominantly bilateral upper lobe ground-glass opacities may
     be infectious or inflammatory in etiology, including atypical or viral
     infections, especially if patient is still immunosuppressed.  Also the
     differential given upper lobe predominance, is hypersensitivity
     pneumonitis/drug reaction.
     
     2.  Minimal bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compression atelectasis.
     Stable atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and coronary circulation.
     
     3.  Likely stable atypical enhancement of the splenic periphery compared to a
     non-contrast [**2547-12-18**] exam, but not definitely present on non- contrast
     [**2547-11-22**] exam. The etiology is unclear but may represent sequelae of prior
     infection or infarction.
     
     4.  Increased hydronephrosis involving the transplant kidney.  Slightly
     prominent enhancement to distal collecting system and ureter suggests
     infection/inflammation in this patient with known UTI/colonization.  No
     radiographic findings to suggest pyelonephritis.
     
     5.  Anasarca.

     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
     normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
     differentiation appears grossly preserved.
     
     There is a new small hypodensity of the left corona radiata (series 2, image
     15), which may represent a lacunar infarct.  Minimal hypodensity in the
     periventricular white matter unchanged from the prior suggests chronic
     microvascular ischemia.
     
     Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.  Again noted is
     opacification of the mastoid air cells on the left.  The previously seen
     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells appears slightly improved
     compared to prior study.
     
     Extensive vascular calcifications are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

     COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT dated [**2548-8-30**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The evaluation of major abdominal organs and vessels is limited due
     to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  There is no evidence of free fluid,
     free air, or fluid collection, bowel dilatation.  No significant
     lymphadenopathy in the upper abdomen.  Again note is made of cholelithiasis,
     without pericholecystic fluid.  The liver is unremarkable without evidence of
     focal liver lesion or ductal dilatation.  There is calcification in the spleen
     and along the splenic arterial route.  Gastroduodenal arteries and other
     branches of the abdominal arteries are densely calcified.  The pancreas is
     atrophic.  Bilateral adrenal glands are within normal limits.  Kidneys are not
     identified in this patient with renal transplant.  The visualized portion of
     large and small intestines are within normal limits.
     
     PELVIS:  Again note is made of transplanted kidney in the left lower quadrant,
     with mild fat stranding surrounding the collecting system, overall unchanged
     since prior study, with slightly improved hydronephrosis, which could be due
     to sequela of UTI.  There is no specific fat stranding in lower pelvis,
     unchanged since prior study.  There is no fluid collection in the
     intraperitoneal cavity in the lower pelvis.  The visualized portion of large
     and small intestines are within normal limits.  There iliac arteries and
     gonadal arteries are densely calcified.  Evaluation of the patency of the
     vessels cannot be performed due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**].
     
     Note is made of bilateral hydroceles with edematous testicles.  The evaluation
     of the scrotum and penis is limited.  There is nonspecific soft tissue
     swelling anterior to the penis. There is calcification along the penis.  These
     findings could represent necrotic penis with purulent drainage noted on
     physical exam and mentioned in the history.
     
     Again note is made of diffuse anasarca.

     (Cont)
     In the visualized portion of the lung bases, slightly increased pleural
     effusion with atelectasis is noted.
     
     There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 92**].  Severe
     atherosclerotic disease and arterial calcifications as described above.  Of
     note, the patencies of these vascular structures, especially penile arteries
     could not be assessed on this study. 
     
     2.  Bilateral hydroceles and edematous testicles.  Soft tissue stranding
     surrounding the penis with calcification, likely due to necrotic penis  on the
     physical examination as noted in the history. The study does not directly
     assess the presence or abscence of penile ischemia.  If indicated, please
     consider further evaluation by ultrasound.
     
     3.  Transplanted kidney in the left lower pelvis, with persistent fat
     stranding surrounding collecting system with slight decrease of the
     hydronephrosis, consistent with known UTI.
     
     4.  Diffuse anasarca.
     
     5.  Slight increase of pleural effusion with atelectasis.

     CT LOWER EXTREMITY WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2548-9-11**]
     
     INDICATION:  50-year-old male status post left below-the-knee amputation on
     [**2548-8-22**].  Please assess for abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial 1.25 mm images of the left lower extremity from the mid
     femur through the amputation were obtained.  Sagittal and coronal reformatted
     images were provided.  Contrast was not administered.  There are no previous
     studies for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The patient is status post left below-the-knee amputation.  Skin staples are
     present at the surgical margin.  Separate from the amputation site at the
     anteromedial aspect of the mid calf, there are several foci of subcutaneous
     gas.  There is an additional focus of gas in the anterolateral aspect just
     adjacent to the tibial cortex seen on series 2, image 188.  No defined fluid
     collection or evidence of abscess is seen.  The gas collections are remote
     from the surgical site, and therefore infection cannot entirely be excluded.
     The underlying cortex appears intact and no evidence of periosteal reaction or
     lysis is seen. There is diffuse reticular stranding in the subcutaneous fat

     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        26.8 mCi Tc-99m MDP ([**2548-9-19**]);
     HISTORY: ESRD, question of calciphylaxis. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Flow images over the lower extremities at the location of the 
     left stump show symmetric flow.  Tissue phase images show prominence of activity
     in the muscle regions. 
      
     Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior 
     projections. Increased tracer uptake is noted in the soft tissue generally
     compatible with renal failure. The muscles of the lower extremities, especially
     the proximal lower extremities, show more marked increased tracer uptake
     consistent with calciphylaxis.  
      
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are not visualized, compatible with end stage
     renal disease.  
       
     IMPRESSION: Findings as described above consistent with calciphylaxis.

     overdose.  Evaluate for hemorrhage, cause of acute mental status change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head CT dated [**2548-9-1**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass, shift of normally
     midline structures or hydrocephalus.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
     preserved.  Again seen is a small hypodensity of the left corona radiata,
     representing a lacunar infarct.  Again seen are hypodensities in the
     periventricular white matter, unchanged from the prior, suggesting chronic
     microvascular infarction.  Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally
     aerated.  Again noted is opacification of the mastoid air cells on the left.
     Previously seen opacification of mastoid air cells on the right has almost
     entirely resolved.
     
     Limited views of the nasopharynx demonstrate grossly symmetric appearance.
     Again noted are extensive calcificatons in the distal intradural vertebral
     arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1329**]-weighted
     imaging is most sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia.
     
     2.  Persistent opacification of the mastoid air cells on the left.
     
     3.  Extensive vascular calcifications.

     FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There are bilateral perihilar
     opacities, consistent with pulmonary edema.  The pulmonary arteries are
     enlarged, likely related to congestion.
     
     There is no change in the position of the right PICC in the proximal SVC as

     EXAMINATION:  AP chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Sepsis.  Possible pneumonia.
     
     A single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2548-9-22**] at 04:30 hours and is
     compared with the prior radiograph performed [**2548-9-21**] at 22:15 hours.  Tubes
     and lines are unchanged.  The appearance of the lungs is not significantly
     different from the prior evening's radiograph with prominent interstitial
     markings consistent with fluid overload/early interstitial edema.  No large
     effusions are evident in this projection.  No areas of frank consolidation are
     apparent.  Incidental note is made of significant calcification in the celiac
     axis.

     INDICATION:  History of failed renal transplant with fever of unknown origin
     and tenderness at site of renal graft.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis, [**2548-9-4**] and multiple priors.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions
     which have increased in size compared to mid September with associated
     bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  There is a small axial hiatal hernia.
     There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
     
     No focal or textural hepatic abnormality is identified.  A small stone is
     likely within the gallbladder.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are
     unremarkable and the kidneys are absent bilaterally.  The size of the spleen
     remains prominent with an irregular hypoattenuating focus near the mid portion
     as seen on [**2548-8-30**] which may represent prior infection/infarction.
     Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable and there is
     no free air or pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes.  There is a moderate amount of ascites.  Scattered atherosclerotic
     mural calcifications of the aorta as well as dense mural calcification of its
     branches including the splenic artery are again noted.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  A transplant kidney is again identified within the
     left lower quadrant which appears to enhance homogeneously.  There is no
     evidence of hydronephrosis with an upper pole parapelvic cyst likely.
     Induration along the collecting system is more prominent compared to September
     2007 of unclear etiology.  The bladder contains a Foley with scattered foci of
     nondependent air within. The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable and no
     pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are identified. A left
     femoral/external iliac central line is in place. An atrophic right pelvic
     renal transplant is reidentified and unchanged.  There is a moderate-sized
     fat- containing left inguinal hernia. Calcification along the penis is
     unchanged.
     
     Note is again made of diffuse anasarca.
     
     Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.

MICU 7 Nursing Progress Note (0700-1900)

Please see flowsheet for all objective data. Very unfortunate 50 year old gentleman with long medical history including failed renal transplant and malignant calciphylaxis with necrotic skin ulcers. Currently admitted with hypotension and mental status changes ?r/t sepsis, narcotic administration.

CNS: Pt. initially very lethargic, yet easily aroused by verbal stim. Difficult to assess his level of orientation. He is in significant pain with turning, dressing changes, etc. Therefore dilaudid .25mg IV given x 2 with good effect prior to CT scan. Upon return, pt increasingly hypotensive (syst in the 70's) and RR dropping to [**5-24**]. Pt received 250cc NS and narcan .4mg IVP. He quickly awoke, began to converse and was able to take a small amount po. He remains disoriented, but mental status significantly improved after narcan. 

RESP: Sats of 100 on 2lnc. Lungs with diminished breath sounds throughout.

CVS: B/P initially in the 90's/syst, dropping down to the 70's as mentioned. Received IVF, yet narcan appears to have the most effect. Heart rate 110, ST without VEA. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test done to [**Last Name (un) 706**] hypotension. Pt has been restarted on prednisone 5mg po.

ID: T max of 99 axillary. BC (surveillance) sent x 1. Caspofungin started for +yeast in urine. He is now on caspo, vanco, meropenum. Abd CT done to assess for any evidence of infection.

GI: Pt taking only small amounts po. ?place feeding tube in near future in order to improve nutritional status and promote healing. Pt has passed 2 soft, brown stools today.

     HISTORY:  50-year-old male with metastatic calcium deposit syndrome, end-stage
     renal disease on hemodialysis, admitted with sepsis, now status post NG tube
     placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  Portable abdominal x-ray of [**2548-9-4**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Portable supine view of the abdomen shows replacement of Dobbhoff
     tube with new NG tube.  The proximal side port of the nasogastric tube likely
     lies at the gastroesophageal junction.  A double-lumen dialysis catheter is
     seen with its tip in the cavoatrial junction.  A left femoral central venous
     catheter is also seen. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely
     representing pleural effusion. Diffuse vascular calcifications are again
     noted.  The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.  Degenerative changes with
     marginal osteophyte formation are seen, particularly at T12-L1.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  NG tube with proximal port at the GE junction.
     2.  Left sided pleural effusion.

      will limit the complication risk of distal tissue necrosis as the patient is 
      already s/p BKA on that side.

     INDICATION:  50-year-old male with end-stage renal disease and metastatic
     calciphylaxis.  Patient requiring a line to obtain accurate blood pressure
     measurements.
     
     The procedure was explained to the health care proxy, the mother of the

     the nature of the procedure.

     radiologist, performed the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left femoral
     artery was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture
     set, on top of the femoral head, as determined by fluoroscopy. Hard copies of
     ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing
     intra-arterial access. A 20-gauge 12-cm arterial catheter was then advanced
     over the wire after the needle was removed.  The catheter was then connected
     to the arterial transducer lines, and direct blood pressure measurements were
     obtained.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     complications.  A final fluoroscopic image confirmed the location of the
     catheter just lateral to the known left femoral venous line.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of left femoral arterial line.  The line is
