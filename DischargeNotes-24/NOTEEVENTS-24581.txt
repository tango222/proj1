Admission Date: [**3399-7-19**]        Discharge Date: [**3399-7-22**]

Date of Birth:  [**3317-12-16**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NME


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Headache and intraventricular hemorrhage.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old right-
handed man, with a history of dementia, Paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, bradycardia status post pacer, and
hypercholesterolemia, who was found by his wife this morning
on the floor.  He had complained of headache last night for
which he got Tylenol and then went to bed.  At 9:00 am, he
was waking up, but told his wife that he wanted to [**Doctor Last Name 209**]
more, and when she checked on him at 10:00 am, she found him
on the floor supine and awake.  He could talk and move
everything, but initially did not recall how he got to the
floor.  Later on, he told doctors that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] had fallen.  His
wife called EMS, and he was brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where
a noncontrast head CT showed blood in the third, fourth and
left lateral ventricle.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies any fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting, neck pain, weakness, numbness, tingling,
dizziness, visual changes, hearing changes, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria or
diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, or bowel/bladder
problems.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Bradycardia, status post pacemaker placement with punctured
lung and confusion as complication. Hypercholesterolemia.
Dementia. ?Parkinsonism.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No strokes or bleeds.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired architect who lives with his
wife in [**Name2 (NI) 1849**].  He quit smoking in [**3380**], and drinks [**2-8**]
alcoholic beverages a day.  There is no drug use.

MEDICATION AT HOME:
1. Zoloft 75 mg po qd.
2. Lipitor 10 mg po qd.
3. Amiodarone 100 mg po qd.
4. Sinemet 25/100 mg bid.
5. Aricept 5 mg po qd.
6. Prilosec 20 mg po qd.
7. Colace 100 mg po bid.
8. Klonopin 0.5 mg po qd.


ALLERGIES:  None.

EXAM ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile, with blood
pressure 128/78, pulse 80, respiratory rate 10, 96 percent on
room air.  Generally, this was a pleasant man in no acute
distress.  Neck was supple without carotid bruits.  Heart had
a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  Neurologic examination - the patient was awake and
alert, cooperative with exam.  He was oriented to person,
place and date.  He was able to do the month's of the year
backward in 4-5 minutes.  His recall was 0/3 at 1 minute.
His language was fluent with good comprehension and
repetition.  Naming was intact.  There was no dysarthria or
paraphasic errors.  There was no apraxia or neglect.  On
cranial nerve exam, pupils were equally round and reactive to
light, 4-3 mm bilaterally.  Visual fields were full to
confrontation.  Funduscopic exam showed clear optic discs
with some diminishing path of the blood vessels into the
fundus, suggestive of early papilledema.  Extraocular eye
movements intact bilaterally without nystagmus.  Facial
sensation was intact and symmetric.  There was a right facial
droop.  Hearing was intact to finger rub bilaterally.
Palatal elevation symmetric.  Sternocleidomastoid and
trapezius normal bilaterally.  Tongue was midline without
fasciculations.  On motor exam, he had normal bulk and tone
bilaterally.  He had full power of 5/5 throughout with no
pronator drift.  There was slight cogwheel rigidity in the
upper extremity with distraction.  On sensory exam, he was
intact to light touch, pinprick, cold temperature, vibration
and proprioception.  On the reflex exam, he was [**3-13**]
throughout except at the plantar reflex he was [**2-10**]
bilaterally.  On coordination, normal finger-nose test. Gait,
again, 
was not assessed.

LABS UPON ADMISSION:  White count 7.6, hematocrit 44.8,
platelet 191, INR 1.2, PTT 26.9, PT 13.5, sodium 144,
potassium 4.1, chloride 105, bicarb 30, BUN 13, creatinine
0.7, glucose 102.  Urinalysis was negative for any infection.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed no infiltrate.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  Showed worsening blood in the temporal
region in the left lateral ventricle, third and fourth
ventricle with hydrocephalus of the ventricle except at the
fourth ventricle.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted initially to the
intensive care unit for frequent neurology checks.  He had a
CTA which showed no evidence of aneurysm.  His blood pressure
was initially controlled with Lopressor, but later on he did
not require any to keep blood pressure less than 140.  A
repeat noncontrast head CT was performed 1 day later which
was found to be stable.  He was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  It was felt that the patient likely had a
traumatic head bleed that neurologically looked quite stable.
He is to have a follow-up noncontrast head CT in 1 month, and
follow-up within the Neurology Clinic.  The patient's Sinemet
was held throughout the hospital course, and he did not have
any worsened symptoms of parkinsonism, so it was felt that he
did not have any parkinson's.  It was recommended that
Sinemet be discontinued.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Traumatic intraventricular hemorrhage.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Dementia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as admission medication, except
for:
Sinemet which discontinued.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow-up with a noncontrast
head CT in 1 month.

Follow-up with primary care doctor in 1 week.

Follow-up with the [**Hospital3 **] Neurology Clinic in [**3399-9-8**].

     HISTORY:  81 year old with possible intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is intraventricular blood in both occipital horns, which is
     greater on the left than the right.  There is also intraventricular blood in
     the 4th ventricle.  There is no hydrocephalus. There is no mass effect or
     shift of the normally midline structures.  There are periventricular
     hypodensities consistent with small vessel ischemic changes. In the left
     temporal [**Doctor Last Name 79**] there is a region of hypodensity which could represent a
     prominent sulcus.  There is no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     There is no skull fracture.  There is irregularity along the right side of the
     arch of the C1 vertebral body which is incompletely evaluated on this study.
     Please see the CT of the cervical spine performed on the same day for complete
     evaluation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     There is intraventricular hemorrhage within the lateral and 4th ventricle.

     FINDINGS:  Again seen is the large right temporal lobe lesion, of an amorphous
     focus of high density with surrounding low density, representing an
     intracranial hemorrhage.  This has decreased since the last examination. 
     There is now only the most minimal amount of shift of midline structures to

     collection is essentially resolved.  Intraventricular blood is no longer
     apparent.  The cerebral ischemic white matter changes in the periventricular
