Admission Date:  [**2526-4-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2526-5-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2464-12-11**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARD-[**Last Name (un) 2783**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 61 year old
male with hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal
disease who had been hospitalized at [**Last Name (un) 5891**] [**Hospital1 **] since
[**4-13**] with complaints of chest pain consistent with anginal
equivalent.  EKG reportedly showed anterolateral ST
elevations and the patient ruled in for an myocardial
infarction but refused repeated advice for cardiac
catheterization on the 4th and [**4-15**].

The patient was transiently intubated for a question of a
systolic arrest versus bradycardic event, but recovered
within less than one day.  Again, during hemodialysis on [**4-18**], the patient developed recurrent chest pain and agreed to
a transfer to [**Hospital1 4**] for
cardiac catheterization.  Please see catheterization report
for full details and summary.

The catheterization showed the patient to have severe three
vessel disease with significantly elevated pulmonary
pressures, left main 70%, left anterior descending 90%, 90%
of circumflex, right coronary artery 90%.  PA was 72/24 with
a wedge of 34.

An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the
Catheterization Laboratory and the patient was transferred to
the Cardiac Care Unit for continuing care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  As stated previously, is significant for coronary artery
disease.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  End-stage renal disease.
5.  Diabetes mellitus.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Lopressor 100 mg twice a day.
2.  Imdur 30 mg q. day.
3.  Celexa 20 mg q. day.
4.  Plavix 75 mg q. day.
5.  Monopril 10 mg q. day.
6.  Folate 1 mg q. day.
7.  Amlodipine 10 mg q. day.
8.  Buspar 7.5 mg q. day.
9.  Lovastatin 20 mg q. day.
10. Calcium acetate 167 mg three times a day.
11. Nephrocaps one q. day.
12. NPH insulin.
13. Terazosin 5 q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives by himself.  His wife was
recently placed in a nursing home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At time of admission, temperature
100.4 F.; heart rate 84; blood pressure 136/87; O2 saturation
100% on four liters nasal cannula.  In general, in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes were moist.  Pupils
equally round and reactive to light with extraocular
movements intact.  Positive jugular venous distention at 11
cm.  Lungs with diffuse crackles.  Heart sounds regular rate
and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft with diminished bowel sounds.
Extremities with no peripheral edema.  Neurologic:  Alert and
oriented times three.

LABORATORY:  Data revealed white blood cell count 9.4,
hematocrit 27.2, platelets 154.  Sodium 140, potassium 5.1,
chloride 100, CO2 21, BUN 44, creatinine 8.1.  Glucose 144.
CK 357.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was cared for by the Cardiology
Team for the first three hospital days.  He remained
hemodynamically stable.  He was brought to dialysis on
several occasions where some fluid was taken off and on [**4-22**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room at which
time he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four.
Please see the Operating Room report for full details.

In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft
times four with a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal,
saphenous vein graft to PDA and PL sequentially.  His bypass
time was 115 minutes.  His cross clamp time was 95 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient had a mean arterial
pressure of 66.  He was in a paced rhythm at 80 beats per
minute.  He had Milrinone at 0.5 mics per kilogram per
minute.  He did well in the immediate postoperative period.
The patient had a metabolic acidosis and was therefore kept
sedated and ventilated.

On postoperative day one, his Milrinone was decreased.  His
intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and ultimately
discontinued.  He was weaned from the ventilator and
successfully extubated.  He also was dialyzed on
postoperative day one.

During that period, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable, however, he required a Neo-Synephrine drip to
maintain an adequate blood pressure.  Over the next two days,
the patient's Milrinone drip was weaned to off.  During that
period, the patient continued to need a Neo-Synephrine drip
to maintain an adequate blood pressure.  He remained
hemodynamically stable.

On postoperative day three, the patient's chest tubes and
pacing wires and Swan-Ganz catheter were discontinued.
However, after initially being weaned off Neo-Synephrine, the
patient was put back on Neo-synephrine because of
hypotension.  He remained on Neo-Synephrine over the next two
days.

On postoperative day six, after hemodialysis, he was weaned
from his Neo-Synephrine and ultimately transferred to the
floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.

Over the next three days with the assistance of the nursing
staff and Physical Therapy, the patient's activity level was
increased.  It was noted on postoperative day eight, that he
had a small amount of bloody sternal drainage.  His incision
was Dermabonded at that time.  He continued to have a small
amount of bloody drainage following that.

On postoperative day nine, it was decided that the patient
was stable and ready for transfer to rehabilitation for
continuing care and rehabilitation following surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At time of transfer, the patient's
physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs with
temperature 98.2 F.; heart rate 84; sinus rhythm; blood
pressure 150/50; respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 94% on
two liters nasal prongs.  Weight preoperatively is 59
kilograms and at discharge is 61.1 kilograms.  On physical
examination, alert and oriented times three, moves all
extremities.  Follows commands.  Respiratory clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm,
S1, S2, with no murmurs.  Sternum is stable.  Incision with
Dermabond.  Small amount of bloody drainage at mid incision.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well perfused with no
edema.  Right saphenous vein graft site incision with
Steri-strips open to air, clean and dry.

LABORATORY:  Data at discharge is white blood cell count 9.3,
hematocrit 32.9, platelets 318.  PT 15.5, PTT 32.5, INR 1.6.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.7, chloride 97, CO2 21, BUN 61,
creatinine 10.5, glucose 109.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 q. day.
2.  Zantac 150 twice a day.
3.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
4.  Erythropoetin 15000 units q. Hemodialysis.
5.  Sevelamer 2400 mg three times a day with meals.
6.  Amiodarone 400 mg q. day times one week, then 200 mg q.
day times one month.
7.  Citalopram 20 mg q. day.
8.  Buspirone 7.5 mg q. day.
9.  Folic acid 1 mg q. day.
10. Atorvastatin 20 mg q. day.
11. Percocet 5/325, one to two tablets q. four hours p.r.n.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft times four with left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal, saphenous vein graft to PDA and PL.
2.  Hypertension.

     An NG tube is seen with tip in the stomach.  There is a right internal jugular
     central venous line containing Swan-Ganz catheter with tip in the main
     pulmonary artery.  Right subclavian central venous line is unchanged.  Three
     chest tubes/mediastinal drains are noted.  The heart is enlarged, and the
     mediastinal contour is more prominent, possibly related to positioning and/or
     post-operative change.   Pulmonary vascular redistribution is present, and the
     lower lobe vessels are less distinct, suggesting mild failure.  There may be a
     small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Intraaortic balloon
     pump is seen approximately 3 cm below the aortic knob.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild CHF.  No evidence of large effusion.

     INDICATION:  Acute MI with IABP, post op CABG.  Question pneumonia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest is compared with a study one
     day ago.
     
     FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are uchanged in the
     interval, with slight widening of the mediastinum consistent with prior CABG.
     There is persistence of bilateral atelectasis at the lung bases, with
     improvement of congestive failure.  There is retrocardiac opacity which likely
     represent atelectasis, but may represent some aspect of pneumonia.  There is
     also some haziness at the right heart border, which may represent some right
     middle lobe atelectasis vs. consolidation.  There is a stable appearance of
     the sternotomy wires.  The IABP is not visualized.  The osseous structures
     appear unremarkable.  There likely is a small left-sided pleural effusion.  
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Improvement of congestive failure pattern.
     2)  Retrocardiac opacity, as well as some opacity adjacent to the right heart
     border may represent atelectasis vs. consolidation.
     3)  Unchanged left-sided pleural effusion.
