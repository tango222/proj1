Admission Date:  [**3447-2-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**3447-2-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**3368-3-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Substernal chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
female with a history of tobacco use, one pack per day times
60 years, and hypothyroidism.  The patient awoke on the
morning of admission with severe substernal chest pain,
shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.  The patient stated
that she had never experienced these symptoms before.

She went to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital 450**] Hospital
where she was found to have electrocardiogram abnormalities
with ST segment elevation in V1-V5 and Q-wave in V1 and V2.
Compared to her prior electrocardiogram, these changes were
new.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was given Aspirin,
started on a Nitroglycerin drip, and was administered
Lovenox.  TB3A inhibitor and thrombolytics were held due to
concern for possible left-sided facial droop.  The patient
did have a head CT which was negative for bleed at the
outside hospital.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 283**] for further management.

The patient was taken directly for cardiac catheterization.
Coronary angiography of her right dominant system revealed
three-vessel disease.  The LMCA was free of flow-limiting
lesions.  The left anterior descending was totally occluded
proximally.  The left circumflex had a proximal 70% stenosis
and mild luminal irregularities throughout.  The dominant
right coronary artery had mild luminal irregularities
throughout with a 50-60% stenosis in its mid segment.  The
occluded proximal left anterior descending was successfully
treated by AngioJet and stenting using two overlapping stents
extending from the proximal to mid left anterior descending.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis within the
stents.  There was no angiographic evidence of dissection in
FAST TIMI-2 flow.  There was a severe, diffuse disease in the
distal left anterior descending which was left untreated.

During the procedure, the patient was given Dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypothyroidism.  Left hip fracture.
Right humerus fracture sustained approximately two weeks ago.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone p.r.n., Levothyroxine, Aspirin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes one pack per day times 60
years.  She denied use of alcohol and drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was an elderly
female lying in bed in no apparent distress.  Vital signs:
Temperature 96.4��, pulse 118, blood pressure 133/81,
respirations 16, oxygen saturation 95% on nonrebreather.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Slight left eye droop.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple.  Difficult to
assess jugular venous distention.  Heart:  Regular, rate and
rhythm.  Heart sounds muffled by intra-aortic balloon pump.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Left femoral
groin line present.  Right arm immobilized in sling.
Neurological:  The patient was alert and oriented times
three.  There was a left eye droop.  Exam otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.1, hematocrit 31.8, platelet
count 320; initial CK 66, MB 3; chemistry showed a BUN and
creatinine of 11 and 1.

Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm, 80 beats per minute,
normal intervals, slight left axis deviation, ST segment
elevation in V2-V5, ST segment depression in II, III and AVF.

Head CT at the outside hospital was negative for bleed.

IMPRESSION:  This was a 78-year-old female with history of
tobacco use and hypothyroidism who was found to have acute
anterior wall myocardial infarction status post
catheterization with stents to left anterior descending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
further management.

1.  Cardiology/ischemia:  The patient was administered
Plavix, beta-blocker, Aspirin, statin, and an ACE inhibitor
was introduced as her blood pressure tolerated.  As noted
above, cardiac catheterization disclosed three-vessel
coronary artery disease.  There was also severe systolic and
diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

Her acute anterior myocardial infarction was managed by acute
PTCA.  She underwent successful AngioJet and stenting of the
occluded proximal left anterior descending, as well as
successful placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.

Due to the finding of three-vessel disease, CT Surgery was
consulted.  The patient will be seen by CT Surgery on [**3-10**], 2:30, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 827**].  At that point, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 14**] will determine when the patient should go to OR.
Coumadin and Plavix should be discontinued one week prior to
surgery.

Lipid panel:  Was obtained during the hospitalization.  The
patient's LDL was mildly elevated at 107.  She will continue
on Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Pump:  As noted above, the patient was initially on
Neo-Synephrine and Dopamine, as well as intra-aortic balloon
pump when she came out of the catheterization lab.  These
pressors were eventually weaned off, and the intra-aortic
balloon pump was also discontinued.

The patient underwent echocardiogram on [**3447-2-12**].  The
results of the echocardiogram disclosed a left atrium normal
in size.  There was moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal
half of the anterior septum, apex and distal anterior wall,
right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal, no aortic regurgitation seen.  The mitral valve
leaflets were mildly thickened.  There was mild 1+ mitral
regurgitation.  There was mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  There was trivial physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Anticoagulation:  The patient was started on Coumadin.  The
patient was maintained on Heparin during her hospital stay.
She was started on Coumadin on [**3447-2-15**], due to
echocardiogram findings of severe hypokinesis of the anterior
wall.  The patient's goal INR is 1.8-2.5.

Rhythm:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm d[**MD Number 850**]
her hospital stay.  She was monitored closely on telemetry.

2.  Hematologic:  The patient was noted to be anemic on
admission with a hematocrit of 31.8.  She was given 2 U
packed red blood cells on [**2-11**].  Iron studies, B12 and
folate were within normal limits; however ferratin was on the
low end of normal at 26.  Due to concern for iron deficiency,
the patient should undergo colonoscopy as an outpatient.

3.  Musculoskeletal:  The patient noted that she had a
humerus fracture two weeks prior to her presentation.
Shoulder film at [**Hospital6 84**]
disclosed a fracture involving the surgical neck and greater
tubercle of the humerus.  There was mild impaction and
anterior displacement of the distal fragment.

The patient was seen by the Orthopedic Service who
recommended that the patient be maintained in a sling.  She
may do passive range of motion and assisted active range of
motion exercises.  They recommended pain control as needed
and that she should follow-up with Orthopedics in 1-2 weeks.

4.  Psychiatry:  The patient has a significant smoking
history.  The patient underwent counseling for smoking
cessation and was maintained on a Nicotine patch during her
hospital stay.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism.
The patient was maintained on Levothyroxine during her
hospital stay.

6.  Infectious disease:  On [**2-13**], the patient spiked a
temperature and was noted to have an area of
cellulitis/phlebitis on her left upper extremity.  Blood
cultures were drawn, and 1 out of 2 bottles initially grew
MRSA.  The patient is to be treated with Vancomycin for a
14-day course via PICC line.  The patient did have additional
sets of blood cultures drawn.  These should be followed for
organisms.  Echocardiogram should be considered.  Since the
patient looks clinically well, it is likely that this initial
organism was a contaminant.  The patient has remained
afebrile since [**2-13**].

7.  FEN:  The patient was maintained on a cardiac
heart-healthy diet during her hospital stay.  She was noted
to have hyponatremia with a sodium of 128 on [**2-16**].  Urine
electrolytes were sent off, and sodium was noted to be less
than 10.  Hyponatremia was likely due to the patient's heart
failure.  Her sodium should be monitored while she is at
rehabilitation.  The patient's fluid intake should be
restricted to 1.5 L a day.

8.  Renal:  The patient's renal function has remained stable
during her hospital stay.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  1.  The patient will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14**] from CT Surgery on [**3-10**], 2:30 p.m.  Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 5440**] office is located at [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5441**].  2.  The patient should follow-up with an orthopedist in
1-2 weeks.  The patient's outpatient orthopedist is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5442**].  The patient's arm should be maintained in a sling
at the present time.  3.  The patient should follow-up with
her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5443**] at the
................. Clinic in [**Location (un) 450**], [**State 427**].  The
patient should see her primary care physician in two weeks.
4.  Due to the patient's anemia, she should undergo
colonoscopy as an outpatient.  5.  The patient's blood
cultures drawn at [**Hospital6 84**] should
be followed; the set from [**2-15**] has been negative for 48
hours.  6.  The patient's sodium should be followed closely
while she is at rehabilitation.  Her fluids should be
restricted to 1.5 L/day.  7.  The patient's INR should be
followed closely with goal INR of 1.8-2.5.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease.
2.  Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3.  Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
4.  Successful AngioJet and stenting of occluded proximal
left anterior descending.

     pump and Swan-Ganz catheter placement.
     
     CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP:  There are no prior films for comparison.  A femoral
     approach Swan-Ganz catheter is seen with tip in the main pulmonary trunk.  An
     intra-aortic balloon pump is also seen with tip immediately below the aortic
     arch, in the ascending aorta.  There is a slight upper tracheal narrowing with
     leftward deviation of the trachea.  This could be secondary to the presence of
     a goiter in this area.  The cardiac silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  A
     vague density seen immediately above the diaphragm in the retrocardiac
     position.  This could represent a hiatal hernia.  No focal opacities are seen
     within the lungs.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Intra-aortic balloon pump and Swan-Ganz catheter in proper
     position.  No pneumothorax.
     
     Possible goiter, with slight tracheal narrowing above the thoracic inlet.
     
     Possible hiatal hernia.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST
     
     The intra aortic balloon pump terminates 4 cm below the aortic arch. Overlying
     EKG leads make exact determination of PA catheter location somewhat difficult.
     However, the catheter tip appears to be lodged too distal within the left
     lower lobar artery.  A mediastinal drain is noted. Heart size is normal. There
     is increased vascularization of the pulmonary vessels, suggestive of mild CHF.
     Small bilateral effusions cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Intra aortic balloon pump somewhat too distal.
     2) Pulmonary artery catheter somewhat too distal within the left lower
     pulmonary artery.
     
     Findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 711**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2923**], at the time of the exam.

     higher than the prior study, approximately 2.5 cm below the superior margin of
     the aortic arch.  Otherwise, no interval change in radiographic appearance of
     the chest.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cellulitis. Request for PICC line placement for antibiotic
     administration.  The IV team was unable to place PICC line at the bedside.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1175**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1176**] with attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 432**] was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     PICC LINE PLACEMENT PROCEDURE:  There were no superficial veins suitable for
     PICC placement. Using ultrasound imaging, a patent vein was identified in the
     left upper extremity. After the area was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion and using Seldinger technique, a 4 french PICC line was
     placed. Fluoroscopic assistance was used to confirm the tip placement in the
     lower SVC. There were no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Technically successful placement of PICC line in the left upper
     extremity. The PICC line is ready for use.
