Admission Date:  [**3408-4-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**3408-5-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**3345-10-12**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Location (un) **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Hyperkalemia and acute
renal failure.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 4471**] is a
62-year-old female with a past medical history significant
for alcoholic pancreatitis and cirrhosis, type 3 diabetes
mellitus, and depression.  The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 930**] Emergency Room complaining of
nausea, anorexia, and weakness.  These symptoms have worsened
over the past week.  She denies any nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea.  She has not noted any decrease in urine output.
In the emergency department, she was found to have a
creatinine of 11, potassium of 8.4, pH of 7.20.  The EKG
revealed evidence of increased QRS interval widening and
peaked T waves.  The patient was given Kayexalate, insulin

line placed emergently for emergency hemodialysis.  She was
then transferred to the medical Intensive Care Unit for
further observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

2.  Type diabetes mellitus, diet controlled, status post
partial gastrectomy with a Billroth II in [**3388**].
3.  History of multiple falls.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  Depression, status post appendectomy, status post total
abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
status post laminectomy.
6.  Degenerative joint disease, status post right shoulder
surgery.
7.  History of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic
insufficiency, history of recurrent lower extremity
cellulitis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aldactone 25 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Carafate 1 mg p.o.t.i.d.
3.  Inderal 60 mg p.o.q.d.

11. Verapamil 40 mg p.o.b.i.d.
12. Vioxx 25 mg p.o.q.d.
13. Zyprexa 10 mg q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to VANCOMYCIN, WHICH
LEADS TO A SEVERE RASH; DEMEROL.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**Location 4472**].
She is close with her son.  She quit alcohol use in the
1980s.  She is homebound.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died of a myocardial
infarction at the age of 49.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient was in bed in no
apparent distress with occasional twitches.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Oropharynx dry.  NECK:  No JVD, no lymphadenopathy.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Midline scar, soft, nontender,
nondistended, good bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  The patient had an area of erythema, warmth,
over the dorsum of her right foot along with an area of
erythema over her inferior/anterior tibia consistent with
cellulitis.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 5.5, hematocrit 28.3, platelet count 297, sodium
124, potassium 8.4, chloride 105, bicarbonate 7, BUN 144,
creatinine 11.9, glucose 87.  Urinalysis revealed the pH of
5.0 with one white blood cell and two white blood cells.  ALT
12, AST 11.  Alkaline phosphatase 225, amylase 40, total
bilirubin 0.3, CK 127, less than 0.3, lipase 9, albumin 3.5,
calcium 6.9, phosphatase 12.2, hematocrit 1.6, pH 7.20, pCO2
24, PAO2 116 on room air.

Chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.

Renal ultrasound was performed showing bilaterally small
echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal disease.
There was no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

PROBLEM LIST:

RENAL FAILURE:  The patient required hemodialysis three times
a week while she was in the hospital, being stable on
hemodialysis.  Surgery Department was consulted and attempted
to place an A-V graft in her right arm, but they were
ultimately unsuccessful.  She will need followup with the
Department of Surgery at a later date for them to attempt a
graft of fistula at another site.  While in the operating
room, she had a right IJ Perm-A-Cath placed for hemodialysis.
The left subclavian Quinton line, which was inserted on
admission, was discontinued before discharge.  The exact
cause of her renal failure was unclear.  Acute and chronic
renal failure may have been precipitated by her NSAID use.

MENTAL STATUS CHANGES:  The patient became nonverbal after
her first course of hemodialysis.  She remained nonverbal for
four days and eventually returned to her baseline mental
status.  She became talkative and returned to her baseline
mental status five days afterwards.  During this time, head
CT was done, which revealed no evidence of intracranial
pathology.  EEG was done, which showed a result consistent
with widespread encephalopathy likely secondary to her renal
failure.  Mental status remained stable throughout the rest
of her hospital stay.

LOWER EXTREMITY CELLULITIS:  The patient was started on
Levofloxacin, Flagyl, and Oxacillin for treatment of her
cellulitis.  On day #10, she was switched to dicloxacillin
with continued improvement of the affected area.  She will
need to complete a total of a 14-day course of Levofloxacin,
Flagyl, and Dicloxacillin.

LINE TIP INFECTION:  Because the femoral and hip culture grew
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and
coagulase-negative staph, the patient was treated with a
five-day course of Linezolid for possible line infection.
She was treated with Linezolid rather than Vancomycin due to
her confirmed allergy to Vancomycin.  Repeat blood cultures
were no growth.  The patient remained afebrile, except for
minor temperature spike of 99.5 four days prior to admission.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was started
on tubes feeds for nutrition upon admission.  She required
frequent electrolyte repletion on the first several days of
admission, but became stable after several courses of
hemodialysis.  The patient was also started on Vitamin B12
injections after discovering that her vitamin B12s were low.
After the mental status had improved, two swallowing studies
were done, which revealed that she was aspirating only thin
liquids.  She was kept on a ground-solid renal diet with
nectar-thickened liquids.  She was given
...................at breakfast, lunch, and dinner and
thiamine and Nephrocaps to for vitamin supplementation.  She
was continued on her outpatient dose of pancrease for her
pancreatic insufficiency.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Thiamine 100 mg p.o.q.d.
3.  Tramadol 25 mg p.o.q.4h to 6h.p.r.n.
4.  Vitamin B12 100 mcg IM q. month.
5.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o.t.i.d. hold if the phosphate
is less than 4.5.
6.  Miconazole powder 2% applied to the feet b.i.d.
7.  Nephrocaps one p.o.q.d.
8.  Pancrease two caps p.o. t.i.d. with meals.
9.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
10. Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.b.i.d.
11. EPO alpha 4000 units subcutaneously IV q Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday at hemodialysis.
12. Trazodone 50 mg p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n.
13. Tylenol 650 mg q.4h to 6h.p.r.n. pain.
14. Levofloxacin 250 mg q.4h.to 8h.times two days.
15. Dicloxacillin 250 mg q.6h.p.o. for two more days.
16. Flagyl 500 mg p.o.b.i.d. times two more days.

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient is to followup with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

PROBLEM LIST:

     HISTORY:  Pre-op for AV fistula creation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate patent cephalic and basilic
     veins bilaterally.  On the right, the basilic vein is .22 cm in the
     antecubital fossa and increases to .36 cm at its transition to the axillary
     vein.  Similar ---- on the left are .33 and .23 cm respectively.  The right
     cephalic vein is .15 cm throughout its course, the left .21 cm at the
     antecubital fossa and .23 cm at its insertion to the subclavian vein.
     
     There are single widely patent, normal appearing brachial arteries
     bilaterally, showing normal triphasic wave forms.  Venous wave forms indicate
     no evidence of high grade venous obstruction.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Bilateral patent cephalic and basilic veins, dimensions as described.
     2)  No indirect evidence of central venous stenosis.
