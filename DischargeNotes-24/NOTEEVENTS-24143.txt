Admission Date:  [**2653-7-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2653-8-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2577-5-18**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to a Discharge Summary dated
up to [**2653-8-4**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Please add:
1.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia:  On [**8-7**], the
patient had a 25 beat course of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia which was asymptomatic and not associated with
hemodynamic instability, however, non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia seven days post myocardial infarction is
suspicious for a re-entrant circuit present in the conduction
system, which is a poor marker for long-term cardiovascular
function and indicates possible risk for sudden death.
Therefore, after the patient's INR was corrected to 1.6 with
Vitamin K which was given subcutaneously, the patient was
taken to the Electrophysiology Service laboratory on [**2653-8-9**], to be evaluated for defibrillation and AICD placement.

The patient was taken to the Electrophysiology Service
Laboratory and found to be inducible for ventricular
tachycardia which indicated that he had a re-entrant circuit
and he had an AICD placed successfully without
complications.  The patient was restarted on Coumadin after
the procedure for prophylaxis from cerebrovascular accident
as a result of his atrial fibrillation.  His INR, however,
was subtherapeutic prior to discharge and he was therefore
given subcutaneously Lovenox to cover him for atrial
fibrillation prophylaxis.  This was to be given until his INR
became therapeutic which would be in the range of 2.0 to 3.0.

2.  Endocrine:  The patient's fingerstick blood glucoses
remained in the range of 120 to 140 throughout the rest of
his hospitalization and he was not started on an oral
hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 978**] at this time, however, due to his
regularly elevated blood glucoses, he should be considered
for an oral hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 978**] to be started on an outpatient
basis with proper surveillance of his sugars.  It will not be
started at this time due to the possibility of medication
induced hypoglycemia with a newly started [**Doctor Last Name 978**].

3.  Pressure Ulcers:  The patient developed decubitus ulcers
on his upper back noticed on [**2653-8-5**].  The ulcers were
from the patient's lack of activity despite the fact that he
was being ambulated and rehabed by Physical Therapy every
day.  The patient had difficulty even sitting up in bed and
the constant pressure of laying on his back with his large
body habitus put him at high risk for developing decubitus
ulcers.  The ulcers were Grade 2 involving skin breakdown but
not involving the underlying dermis.  They were not infected
at any point and never exhibited purulent exudate.  The
ulcers were dressed with silver sulfadiazine twice a day with
dressing changes twice a day and improved after the 28th with
increased activity and the dressings.

DISPOSITION:   The patient will be discharged to an inpatient
Physical Rehabilitation Center for his functionality status
post myocardial infarction.

The patient reported being able to completely function with
all his activities of daily living prior to his myocardial
infarction and is currently unable to lift himself up in bed
or walk on his own.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Furosemide 80 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Neutra-Phos two packets p.o. twice a day.
6.  Docusate 100 mg p.o. twice a day p.r.n. constipation.
7.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day times 25 days.
9.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
10  Celexa 20 mg p.o. q. day.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Fair.

DISPOSITION:   The patient is discharged to the Inpatient
Rehabilitation Facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction.

     CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  The heart is markedly enlarged. There is a small left
     sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.  There is some vascular
     redistribution but no overt failure.  There has been interval placement of an
     ICD device. The leads appear to be in appropriate location on the AP view,
     however, the lateral view is suboptimal due to lack of penetration and
     placement of the patient's arms.  A repeat lateral is suggested with increased
     penetration and elevating the patient's arms.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Cardiomegaly without overt failure.
     2. Small left sided effusion with associated atelectasis.
     3. Status post ICD placement. Leads apparently in appropriate location on the
     AP view however, the lateral view is suboptimal and repeat is recommended
     utilizing greater penetration and elevation of the patient's arms.
