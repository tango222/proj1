CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year-old gentleman
who was in his usual state of good health until five days
prior to admission when he developed diffuse mild abdominal
discomfort primarily located in the epigastrium while
cleaning his bathtub.  The pain had been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 501**] in

years ago and his last trip to the island was two years ago.
He lives with his wife.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs afebrile.  Blood
pressure 146/80.  Pulse 76.  Respiratory rate 12.  HEENT
pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Mild scleral
icterus is noted.  Sublingual jaundice is also noted.

tenderness worse in the epigastrium.  No palpable liver or
spleen.  No rebound or guarding.  Positive [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  2+ palpable
dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse bilaterally.
Neurological, alert and oriented times three.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 10.7,
hematocrit 39.7.  Platelets 261.  ALT 185, AST 200, LDH 316,
T bili 6.0, direct bili 4.7, indirect bili 1.3, amylase 96,
lipase 193.  CT of the abdomen, gallbladder with multiple
stones.  Gallbladder with heterogeneous appearance at the
fundus.  Normal liver parenchyma, but no clear delineation
between the gallbladder and liver.  No ductal dilatation.  8
mm nodule of the adrenal likely incidentaloma.  Multiple
colonic diverticula.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound no
intra or extra hepatic ductal dilatation.  Focal fatty
infiltration is note, however.  Electrocardiogram normal
sinus rhythm at a rate of 92, axis 54, 138, 120, 422.  Right
bundle branch block with occasionally abnormally conducted
beats.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service for a general surgery consultation.  The appearance
of the patient's gallbladder on imaging studies was
concerning for a tumor process.  The patient did go to
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**3218-12-19**].  The major findings were hemobilia from the sphincter
of Oddi.  No filling of the gallbladder or cystic duct were
noted on biliary images, otherwise a normal biliary tree and
normal pancreatic duct were visualized.  The patient had a
stent placed at the time.  The patient's total bilirubin
appeared to peak at 10.3, which was the morning following the
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography after which
point it began to trend down.  The patient underwent hepatic
angiogram d[**MD Number 850**] which time he had embolization of a right
hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm.

The patient was started on antibiotics in preparation for
surgical exploration.  However, in the face of a hematocrit
that had dropped to 24 from a baseline of 38 the patient
developed rapid NSVT at a rate of 160, which broke with 20 mg
of Lopressor.  The patient was then maintained on a maximal
dose of Lopresor for rate control and surgery was deferred.
On [**3218-12-24**] after consultation between the gastrointestinal
and surgical attendings who were Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1765**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
respectively, it was felt that given the patient's stable
hematocrit, stable clinical status and afebrile state that
the possibility of cholecystitis irritating a pseudoaneurysm
that developed from chronic inflammation was a likely
possibility in this scenario.  If this was indeed what was
taking place, the further reason that surgery could be
deferred until the alleged inflammation of his gallbladder
could be fully treated with a course of antibiotics and that
surgery could be done in a more controlled setting when the
risk of bleeding was less.  Prior to this assessment there
was consideration of involving the hepatobiliary surgeons for
possible segmentectomy of an infiltrating mass.  On [**3218-12-25**],
the patient was felt to be stable for discharge home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Amlodipine 10 mg po q.d.,
Ciprofloxacin 50 mg po b.i.d. times ten days, Colace 100 mg
po b.i.d., Doxepin 50 mg po q.h.s. prn, Lasix 40 mg po q.d.,
Lisinopril 40 mg po q.d., Atenolol 100 mg q.d., Metronidazole
500 mg po t.i.d. times ten days, Pantoprazole 40 mg q.d.,
Glyburide 5 mg po q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hemobilia.
2.  Right hepatic arterial pseudoaneurysm status post
embolization.
3.  Acute cholecystitis versus gallbladder adenocarcinoma.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] the patient's primary care physician in one to two
weeks and the patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
general surgery in two weeks for reevaluation in preparation
for elective surgery.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Upper abdominal pain radiating to the back.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast and 150 mL
     Optiray.  There is no prior study for comparison.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The distal thoracic aorta is tortuous but of normal
     caliber.  There is multifocal subsegmental atelectasis in the lingula and
     lower lobes.
     
     The gallbladder contains multiple stones.  The gallbladder fundus has a
     heterogeneous appearance, without a distinct border with the liver.  While
     this may represent chronic cholecystitis, gallbladder carcinoma may have this
     appearance.  Elsewhere the liver is normal.  There is no biliary ductal
     dilatation.  There is no ascites. The spleen is normal in size.
     
     The pancreas is atrophic.  No masses are identified.  There is an 8 mm
     nonspecific nodule within the right adrenal gland.  A sub-cm cyst is noted in
     the lower pole of the right kidney.
     
     The aorta is of normal caliber.  There is no retroperitoneal lymph node
     enlargement.  The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable.  There are
     multiple colonic diverticula, without adjacent inflammation.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The appendix is normal.  There are numerous sigmoid
     diverticula, without adjacent inflammation.  There is a 2.4 cm aneurysm of the
     left internal iliac artery.  The left common and right internal iliac arteries
     are also ectatic.  The distal ureters are of normal caliber. The urinary
     bladder is unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged. There is no free fluid.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate mild degenerative changes.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Gallstones within a heterogeneous gallbladder.  Though cholecystitis is a
     consideration, gallbladder malignancy with local extension into the liver
     should be considered.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      74 year old man with 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      74 yo gentleman w/h/o epigastric pain, elevated transaminases, Bili=10, and CT
      demonstrating a mass lesion c/w GB carcinoma.  ERCP revealed frank hemobilia;
      there is a concern to r/o AVM-lesion prior to resection. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  74 year old male with epigastric pain, elevated
     bilirubin and frank hemobilia, needs hepatic arteriogram.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending radiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**], interventional
     radiology fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4251**] [**Name (STitle) **].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 432**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     After local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine the right groin was accessed using a
     19 gauge needle.  A .038 guidewire was placed under fluoroscopic observation
     into the abdominal aorta.  Over the wire a 5 French sheath was placed, through
     which a 5 French Cobra catheter was placed under fluoroscopic observation. The
     tip of the catheter was placed in the right common hepatic artery, and
     angiogram obtained.  A .035 glidewire was used to select the right proper
     hepatic artery, and angiograms in multiple obliquities obtained.  A microwire
     and tracker catheter was used to subselect a branch of the right hepatic
     artery which demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm.  Attempts were made to engage the
     neck of the aneurysm, and after being achieved, contrast injection
     demonstrated opacification of the biliary system indicating that this lesion
     was the source of the patient's hemobilia.  With the tracker catheter at the
     orifice of the aneurysm thrombin was injected under fluoroscopic observation
     until flow in the aneurysm had stopped.  The catheter was withdrawn into the
     proper hepatic artery and angiogram was then obtained.  The catheter was used
     under fluoroscopic observation to select the superior mesenteric artery, and a
     superior mesenteric artery angiogram was obtained.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Patient received 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.  Under
     continuous monitoring the patient received small divided doses of Versed
     totaling 1 mg, and fentanyl totaling 100 micrograms.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.
                                                                 (Over)

     FINDINGS:  Angiogram of the common hepatic artery demonstrated an
     approximately 3-4 cm aneurysm seen arising proximally from a branch of the
     right hepatic artery.  There is also a large gallstone seen, and prominent
     tortuous vessels seen in distribution of the cystic artery which may be
     neovascularity.  After thrombin injection there was no longer filling of the
     pseudoaneurysm.  The pseudoaneurysm was treated with 3000 units of thrombin.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Successful embolization of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm with thrombin as
     described above.
     2.  Tortuous neovascularity in the distribution of the cystic artery may be
     tumor blush.

     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     After local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine the right groin was accessed using a
     19 gauge needle.  A .038 guidewire was placed under fluoroscopic observation
     into the abdominal aorta.  Over the wire a 5 French sheath was placed, through
     which a 5 French Cobra catheter was placed under fluoroscopic observation. The
     tip of the catheter was placed in the right common hepatic artery, and
     angiogram obtained.  A .035 glidewire was used to select the right proper
     hepatic artery, and angiograms in multiple obliquities obtained.  A microwire
     and tracker catheter was used to subselect a branch of the right hepatic
     artery which demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm.  Attempts were made to engage the
     neck of the aneurysm, and after being achieved, contrast injection
     demonstrated opacification of the biliary system indicating that this lesion
     was the source of the patient's hemobilia.  With the tracker catheter at the
     orifice of the aneurysm thrombin was injected under fluoroscopic observation
     until flow in the aneurysm had stopped.  The catheter was withdrawn into the
     proper hepatic artery and angiogram was then obtained.  The catheter was used
     under fluoroscopic observation to select the superior mesenteric artery, and a
     superior mesenteric artery angiogram was obtained.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Patient received 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.  Under
     continuous monitoring the patient received small divided doses of Versed
     totaling 1 mg, and fentanyl totaling 100 micrograms.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.

     FINDINGS:  Angiogram of the common hepatic artery demonstrated an
     approximately 3-4 cm aneurysm seen arising proximally from a branch of the
     right hepatic artery.  There is also a large gallstone seen, and prominent
     tortuous vessels seen in distribution of the cystic artery which may be

     FINDINGS:  Angiogram of the common hepatic artery demonstrated an
     approximately 3-4 cm aneurysm seen arising proximally from a branch of the
     right hepatic artery.  There is also a large gallstone seen, and prominent
     tortuous vessels seen in distribution of the cystic artery which may be
     neovascularity.  After thrombin injection there was no longer filling of the
     pseudoaneurysm.  The pseudoaneurysm was treated with 3000 units of thrombin.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Successful embolization of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm with thrombin as
     described above.
     2.  Tortuous neovascularity in the distribution of the cystic artery may be
     tumor blush.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      74 year old man with 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      74 yo gentleman w/h/o epigastric pain, elevated transaminases, Bili=10, and CT
      demonstrating a mass lesion c/w GB carcinoma.  ERCP revealed frank hemobilia;
      there is a concern to r/o AVM-lesion prior to resection. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  74 year old male with epigastric pain, elevated
     bilirubin and frank hemobilia, needs hepatic arteriogram.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending radiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**], interventional
     radiology fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4251**] [**Name (STitle) **].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 432**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     After local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine the right groin was accessed using a
     19 gauge needle.  A .038 guidewire was placed under fluoroscopic observation
     into the abdominal aorta.  Over the wire a 5 French sheath was placed, through
     which a 5 French Cobra catheter was placed under fluoroscopic observation. The
     tip of the catheter was placed in the right common hepatic artery, and
     angiogram obtained.  A .035 glidewire was used to select the right proper
     hepatic artery, and angiograms in multiple obliquities obtained.  A microwire
     and tracker catheter was used to subselect a branch of the right hepatic
     artery which demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm.  Attempts were made to engage the
     neck of the aneurysm, and after being achieved, contrast injection
     demonstrated opacification of the biliary system indicating that this lesion
     was the source of the patient's hemobilia.  With the tracker catheter at the
     orifice of the aneurysm thrombin was injected under fluoroscopic observation
     until flow in the aneurysm had stopped.  The catheter was withdrawn into the
     proper hepatic artery and angiogram was then obtained.  The catheter was used
     under fluoroscopic observation to select the superior mesenteric artery, and a
     superior mesenteric artery angiogram was obtained.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Patient received 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.  Under
     continuous monitoring the patient received small divided doses of Versed
     totaling 1 mg, and fentanyl totaling 100 micrograms.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.
                                                                 (Over)

     ENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.
     
     INDICATION:  Gallbladder mass.
     
     150 ml of non-ionic contrast was administered given patient's history of
     diabetes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-enhanced and enhanced images through the abdomen with delayed
     images through the abdomen and pelvis.
     
     NON-ENHANCED AND ENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
     
     Compared to [**3218-12-18**].
     
     In the interval, the patient has had a common bile duct stent placed which is
     in satisfactory position.  No biliary tree dilatation.
     
     Two gallstones are again noted in a markedly abnormal gallbladder with
     thickening of the wall and irregular contours with some low attenuation in the
     adjacent liver.
     
     As described previously, this appearance does raise the possibility of
     gallbladder carcinoma.
     
     The only change in the appearance of the gallbladder is that previously some
     high-attenuation material consistent with hemobilia and blood clot was present
     in the gallbladder.  On today's exam, this blood clot seems to have retracted
     somewhat and more low attenuation fluid consistent with bile is seen.
     
     As before, a small low-attenuation region at the lower pole of the right
     kidney consistent with small renal cyst is present.
     
     The liver is otherwise unremarkable with no new abnormalities noted.  The
     pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and visualized portions of the bowel and
     mesentery and major intra- and retroperitoneal structures are normal.

     There is aneurysmal dilation of the proximal left common iliac artery and a

     The prostate gland is enlarged measuring 6.7 x 5.6 cm.
     
     No masses, free fluid or lymphadenopathy.  Bilateral fat-containing inguinal
     hernias.  A small amount of fluid is seen on the last cut of the pelvis which
     may reflect a small right hydrocele.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No biliary tree dilatation to account for the patient's rising bilirubin.
     
     2) Slight retraction of some of the blood clot in the gallbladder.
     
     3) Otherwise, no appreciable change.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 75-year-old male with metastatic gallbladder carcinoma. The
     patient presented with a history of hemobilia in previous months, and an
     arteriogram documented a right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm at that time,
     which was injected with thrombin with good result. The patient now presents
     with hematemesis. An upper GI endoscopy performed today documents active
     bleeding from the ampulla of Vater.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1175**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 894**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 185 ml of Optiray 320 full-strength. A total of 2 mg
     Versed and 100 microg Fentanyl were given intravenously in divided doses under
     continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was described to the patient and informed consent was obtained.
     Access into the left common femoral artery was gained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was placed without difficulty into the
     aorta, and the needle was exchanged for a 5 Fr sheath. The celiac axis was
     then selectively catheterized using a 5 Fr Cobra C2 Glidecath, and an
     arteriogram was performed. This showed filling of both the common hepatic and
     splenic arteries, without evidence for active extravasation or vascular
     malformation. A selective proper hepatic arteriogram was then performed and
     shows an eccentric irregular opacity projecting from a branch of the proximal
     right hepatic artery, similar in size and location to the previously described
     pneudoaneurysm. With the catheter in the proper hepatic artery, multiple
     obliquities were obtained, comfirming presence of a recurrent pseudoaneurysm.
     Other results of abnormal irregular tiny vascular pattern noted throughout
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     both right and left hepatic lobes suggesting underlying disease. Gallbladder
     calculi are also present.
     
     Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed. This
     demonstrated no anatomic variant, vascular abnormalities or contrast
     extravasation but the vascular appears matted and splayed, suggesting
     extrinsic mass effect. Delayed images through the superior mesenteric
     arteriogram show filling of the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, with
     some retrograde filling of the splenic vein documenting patency.
     
     The gastroduodenal artery was then selective catheterized, again using the C2
     glidecath. This arteriogram demonstrated no extravasation or AV malformation.
     The inferior pancreaticoduodenal arcades are visualized and are somewhat
     small. Reflux into the proper, right and left hepatic arteries was also
     present.
     
     Using an 0.035 angled glidewire, it was possible to advance the C2 glidecath
     farther into the gastroduodenal artery to better visualize the vasculature and
     to prevent reflux into the proper hepatic artery. The gastroepiploic artery is
     well visualized and shows no abnormalities. Again no extravasation or
     malformation is identified involving the gastroduodenal artery or its
     tributaries.
     
     At this time, the C2 glidecath was advanced well into the right hepatic
     artery, using both 0.035 angled glidewire as well an 0.035 stiff glidewire.
     The catheter was manipulated beyond the right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm,
     as documented by a small amount of contrast injection. The catheter was
     withdrawn to a point just distal from the pseudoaneurym, and one 6 mm x 5 cm
     platinum coil was deployed using the reversed end of an 0.035 angled
     glidewire. The coil formed shortly after dislodgement. After 2 minutes, a
     small hand injection documented sluggish flow beyond coil placement. The
     catheter was then gently manipulated back to the level of the pseudoaneurysm,
     and three more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were placed in this region. This was followed
     by infusion of Gelfoam pledgets (mixed with contrast material) just proximal
     to the pseudoaneurysm. Two more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were deployed proximally,
     again followed by Gelfoam pledgets.
     
     A proper hepatic arteriogram was performed approximately 10 min after coil and
     Gelfoam embolization, and demonstrated a significantly reduced flow through
     the right hepatic artery, with normal perfusion of the left hepatic artery.
     There was no residual filling of the pseudoaneurysm. Contrast reflux into the
     gastroduodenal and gastroepiploic arteries.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful coil and Gelfoam embolization, both proximally and
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      75 yo m with adenoca of gallbladder, admitted with UGI bleed, now with active
      hemobilia on EGD. Please perform angio of biliary circulation and embolization
      as needed.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 75-year-old male with metastatic gallbladder carcinoma. The
     patient presented with a history of hemobilia in previous months, and an
     arteriogram documented a right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm at that time,
     which was injected with thrombin with good result. The patient now presents
     with hematemesis. An upper GI endoscopy performed today documents active
     bleeding from the ampulla of Vater.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1175**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 894**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 185 ml of Optiray 320 full-strength. A total of 2 mg
     Versed and 100 microg Fentanyl were given intravenously in divided doses under
     continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was described to the patient and informed consent was obtained.
     Access into the left common femoral artery was gained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was placed without difficulty into the
     aorta, and the needle was exchanged for a 5 Fr sheath. The celiac axis was
     then selectively catheterized using a 5 Fr Cobra C2 Glidecath, and an
     arteriogram was performed. This showed filling of both the common hepatic and
     splenic arteries, without evidence for active extravasation or vascular
     malformation. A selective proper hepatic arteriogram was then performed and
     shows an eccentric irregular opacity projecting from a branch of the proximal
     right hepatic artery, similar in size and location to the previously described
     pneudoaneurysm. With the catheter in the proper hepatic artery, multiple
     obliquities were obtained, comfirming presence of a recurrent pseudoaneurysm.
     Other results of abnormal irregular tiny vascular pattern noted throughout
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     both right and left hepatic lobes suggesting underlying disease. Gallbladder
     calculi are also present.
     
     Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed. This
     demonstrated no anatomic variant, vascular abnormalities or contrast
     extravasation but the vascular appears matted and splayed, suggesting
     extrinsic mass effect. Delayed images through the superior mesenteric
     arteriogram show filling of the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, with
     some retrograde filling of the splenic vein documenting patency.
     
     The gastroduodenal artery was then selective catheterized, again using the C2
     glidecath. This arteriogram demonstrated no extravasation or AV malformation.
     The inferior pancreaticoduodenal arcades are visualized and are somewhat
     small. Reflux into the proper, right and left hepatic arteries was also
     present.
     
     Using an 0.035 angled glidewire, it was possible to advance the C2 glidecath
     farther into the gastroduodenal artery to better visualize the vasculature and
     to prevent reflux into the proper hepatic artery. The gastroepiploic artery is
     well visualized and shows no abnormalities. Again no extravasation or
     malformation is identified involving the gastroduodenal artery or its
     tributaries.
     
     At this time, the C2 glidecath was advanced well into the right hepatic
     artery, using both 0.035 angled glidewire as well an 0.035 stiff glidewire.
     The catheter was manipulated beyond the right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm,
     as documented by a small amount of contrast injection. The catheter was
     withdrawn to a point just distal from the pseudoaneurym, and one 6 mm x 5 cm
     platinum coil was deployed using the reversed end of an 0.035 angled
     glidewire. The coil formed shortly after dislodgement. After 2 minutes, a
     small hand injection documented sluggish flow beyond coil placement. The
     catheter was then gently manipulated back to the level of the pseudoaneurysm,
     and three more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were placed in this region. This was followed
     by infusion of Gelfoam pledgets (mixed with contrast material) just proximal
     to the pseudoaneurysm. Two more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were deployed proximally,
     again followed by Gelfoam pledgets.
     
     A proper hepatic arteriogram was performed approximately 10 min after coil and
     Gelfoam embolization, and demonstrated a significantly reduced flow through
     the right hepatic artery, with normal perfusion of the left hepatic artery.
     There was no residual filling of the pseudoaneurysm. Contrast reflux into the
     gastroduodenal and gastroepiploic arteries.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful coil and Gelfoam embolization, both proximally and
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      75 yo m with adenoca of gallbladder, admitted with UGI bleed, now with active
      hemobilia on EGD. Please perform angio of biliary circulation and embolization
      as needed.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 75-year-old male with metastatic gallbladder carcinoma. The
     patient presented with a history of hemobilia in previous months, and an
     arteriogram documented a right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm at that time,
     which was injected with thrombin with good result. The patient now presents
     with hematemesis. An upper GI endoscopy performed today documents active
     bleeding from the ampulla of Vater.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1175**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 894**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 185 ml of Optiray 320 full-strength. A total of 2 mg
     Versed and 100 microg Fentanyl were given intravenously in divided doses under
     continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was described to the patient and informed consent was obtained.
     Access into the left common femoral artery was gained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was placed without difficulty into the
     aorta, and the needle was exchanged for a 5 Fr sheath. The celiac axis was
     then selectively catheterized using a 5 Fr Cobra C2 Glidecath, and an
     arteriogram was performed. This showed filling of both the common hepatic and
     splenic arteries, without evidence for active extravasation or vascular
     malformation. A selective proper hepatic arteriogram was then performed and
     shows an eccentric irregular opacity projecting from a branch of the proximal
     right hepatic artery, similar in size and location to the previously described
     pneudoaneurysm. With the catheter in the proper hepatic artery, multiple
     obliquities were obtained, comfirming presence of a recurrent pseudoaneurysm.
     Other results of abnormal irregular tiny vascular pattern noted throughout
                                                                 (Over)

     both right and left hepatic lobes suggesting underlying disease. Gallbladder
     calculi are also present.
     
     Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed. This
     demonstrated no anatomic variant, vascular abnormalities or contrast
     extravasation but the vascular appears matted and splayed, suggesting
     extrinsic mass effect. Delayed images through the superior mesenteric
     arteriogram show filling of the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, with
     some retrograde filling of the splenic vein documenting patency.
     
     The gastroduodenal artery was then selective catheterized, again using the C2
     glidecath. This arteriogram demonstrated no extravasation or AV malformation.
     The inferior pancreaticoduodenal arcades are visualized and are somewhat
     small. Reflux into the proper, right and left hepatic arteries was also
     present.
     
     Using an 0.035 angled glidewire, it was possible to advance the C2 glidecath
     farther into the gastroduodenal artery to better visualize the vasculature and
     to prevent reflux into the proper hepatic artery. The gastroepiploic artery is
     well visualized and shows no abnormalities. Again no extravasation or
     malformation is identified involving the gastroduodenal artery or its
     tributaries.
     
     At this time, the C2 glidecath was advanced well into the right hepatic
     artery, using both 0.035 angled glidewire as well an 0.035 stiff glidewire.
     The catheter was manipulated beyond the right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm,
     as documented by a small amount of contrast injection. The catheter was
     withdrawn to a point just distal from the pseudoaneurym, and one 6 mm x 5 cm
     platinum coil was deployed using the reversed end of an 0.035 angled
     glidewire. The coil formed shortly after dislodgement. After 2 minutes, a
     small hand injection documented sluggish flow beyond coil placement. The
     catheter was then gently manipulated back to the level of the pseudoaneurysm,
     and three more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were placed in this region. This was followed
     by infusion of Gelfoam pledgets (mixed with contrast material) just proximal
     to the pseudoaneurysm. Two more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were deployed proximally,
     again followed by Gelfoam pledgets.
     
     A proper hepatic arteriogram was performed approximately 10 min after coil and
     Gelfoam embolization, and demonstrated a significantly reduced flow through
     the right hepatic artery, with normal perfusion of the left hepatic artery.
     There was no residual filling of the pseudoaneurysm. Contrast reflux into the
     gastroduodenal and gastroepiploic arteries.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful coil and Gelfoam embolization, both proximally and
                                                                 (Over)

      75 yo m with adenoca of gallbladder, admitted with UGI bleed, now with active
      hemobilia on EGD. Please perform angio of biliary circulation and embolization
      as needed.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 75-year-old male with metastatic gallbladder carcinoma. The
     patient presented with a history of hemobilia in previous months, and an
     arteriogram documented a right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm at that time,
     which was injected with thrombin with good result. The patient now presents
     with hematemesis. An upper GI endoscopy performed today documents active
     bleeding from the ampulla of Vater.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1175**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 894**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 185 ml of Optiray 320 full-strength. A total of 2 mg
     Versed and 100 microg Fentanyl were given intravenously in divided doses under
     continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was described to the patient and informed consent was obtained.
     Access into the left common femoral artery was gained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was placed without difficulty into the
     aorta, and the needle was exchanged for a 5 Fr sheath. The celiac axis was
     then selectively catheterized using a 5 Fr Cobra C2 Glidecath, and an
     arteriogram was performed. This showed filling of both the common hepatic and
     splenic arteries, without evidence for active extravasation or vascular
     malformation. A selective proper hepatic arteriogram was then performed and
     shows an eccentric irregular opacity projecting from a branch of the proximal
     right hepatic artery, similar in size and location to the previously described
     pneudoaneurysm. With the catheter in the proper hepatic artery, multiple
     obliquities were obtained, comfirming presence of a recurrent pseudoaneurysm.
     Other results of abnormal irregular tiny vascular pattern noted throughout
                                                                 (Over)

     both right and left hepatic lobes suggesting underlying disease. Gallbladder
     calculi are also present.
     
     Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed. This
     demonstrated no anatomic variant, vascular abnormalities or contrast
     extravasation but the vascular appears matted and splayed, suggesting
     extrinsic mass effect. Delayed images through the superior mesenteric
     arteriogram show filling of the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, with
     some retrograde filling of the splenic vein documenting patency.
     
     The gastroduodenal artery was then selective catheterized, again using the C2
     glidecath. This arteriogram demonstrated no extravasation or AV malformation.
     The inferior pancreaticoduodenal arcades are visualized and are somewhat
     small. Reflux into the proper, right and left hepatic arteries was also
     present.
     
     Using an 0.035 angled glidewire, it was possible to advance the C2 glidecath
     farther into the gastroduodenal artery to better visualize the vasculature and
     to prevent reflux into the proper hepatic artery. The gastroepiploic artery is
     well visualized and shows no abnormalities. Again no extravasation or
     malformation is identified involving the gastroduodenal artery or its
     tributaries.
     
     At this time, the C2 glidecath was advanced well into the right hepatic
     artery, using both 0.035 angled glidewire as well an 0.035 stiff glidewire.
     The catheter was manipulated beyond the right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm,
     as documented by a small amount of contrast injection. The catheter was
     withdrawn to a point just distal from the pseudoaneurym, and one 6 mm x 5 cm
     platinum coil was deployed using the reversed end of an 0.035 angled
     glidewire. The coil formed shortly after dislodgement. After 2 minutes, a
     small hand injection documented sluggish flow beyond coil placement. The
     catheter was then gently manipulated back to the level of the pseudoaneurysm,
     and three more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were placed in this region. This was followed
     by infusion of Gelfoam pledgets (mixed with contrast material) just proximal
     to the pseudoaneurysm. Two more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were deployed proximally,
     again followed by Gelfoam pledgets.
     
     A proper hepatic arteriogram was performed approximately 10 min after coil and
     Gelfoam embolization, and demonstrated a significantly reduced flow through
     the right hepatic artery, with normal perfusion of the left hepatic artery.

     Using an 0.035 angled glidewire, it was possible to advance the C2 glidecath
     farther into the gastroduodenal artery to better visualize the vasculature and
     to prevent reflux into the proper hepatic artery. The gastroepiploic artery is
     well visualized and shows no abnormalities. Again no extravasation or
     malformation is identified involving the gastroduodenal artery or its
     tributaries.
     
     At this time, the C2 glidecath was advanced well into the right hepatic
     artery, using both 0.035 angled glidewire as well an 0.035 stiff glidewire.
     The catheter was manipulated beyond the right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm,
     as documented by a small amount of contrast injection. The catheter was
     withdrawn to a point just distal from the pseudoaneurym, and one 6 mm x 5 cm
     platinum coil was deployed using the reversed end of an 0.035 angled
     glidewire. The coil formed shortly after dislodgement. After 2 minutes, a
     small hand injection documented sluggish flow beyond coil placement. The
     catheter was then gently manipulated back to the level of the pseudoaneurysm,
     and three more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were placed in this region. This was followed
     by infusion of Gelfoam pledgets (mixed with contrast material) just proximal
     to the pseudoaneurysm. Two more 6 mm x 5 cm coils were deployed proximally,
     again followed by Gelfoam pledgets.
     
     A proper hepatic arteriogram was performed approximately 10 min after coil and
     Gelfoam embolization, and demonstrated a significantly reduced flow through
     the right hepatic artery, with normal perfusion of the left hepatic artery.
     There was no residual filling of the pseudoaneurysm. Contrast reflux into the
     gastroduodenal and gastroepiploic arteries.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful coil and Gelfoam embolization, both proximally and
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man with adenoca of gallbladder
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      75 yo m with adenoca of gallbladder, admitted with UGI bleed, now with active
      hemobilia on EGD. Please perform angio of biliary circulation and embolization
      as needed.
       
      questions please page [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2805**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2806**] [**Pager number 4259**] thanks

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 75-year-old male with metastatic gallbladder carcinoma. The
     patient presented with a history of hemobilia in previous months, and an
     arteriogram documented a right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm at that time,
     which was injected with thrombin with good result. The patient now presents
     with hematemesis. An upper GI endoscopy performed today documents active
     bleeding from the ampulla of Vater.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1175**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 894**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 185 ml of Optiray 320 full-strength. A total of 2 mg
     Versed and 100 microg Fentanyl were given intravenously in divided doses under
     continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was described to the patient and informed consent was obtained.
     Access into the left common femoral artery was gained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was placed without difficulty into the
     aorta, and the needle was exchanged for a 5 Fr sheath. The celiac axis was
     then selectively catheterized using a 5 Fr Cobra C2 Glidecath, and an
     arteriogram was performed. This showed filling of both the common hepatic and
     splenic arteries, without evidence for active extravasation or vascular
     malformation. A selective proper hepatic arteriogram was then performed and
     shows an eccentric irregular opacity projecting from a branch of the proximal
     right hepatic artery, similar in size and location to the previously described
     pneudoaneurysm. With the catheter in the proper hepatic artery, multiple
     obliquities were obtained, comfirming presence of a recurrent pseudoaneurysm.
     Other results of abnormal irregular tiny vascular pattern noted throughout
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     both right and left hepatic lobes suggesting underlying disease. Gallbladder
     calculi are also present.
     
     Selective superior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed. This
     demonstrated no anatomic variant, vascular abnormalities or contrast
     extravasation but the vascular appears matted and splayed, suggesting
     extrinsic mass effect. Delayed images through the superior mesenteric
     arteriogram show filling of the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, with
     some retrograde filling of the splenic vein documenting patency.
     
     The gastroduodenal artery was then selective catheterized, again using the C2
     glidecath. This arteriogram demonstrated no extravasation or AV malformation.
     The inferior pancreaticoduodenal arcades are visualized and are somewhat
     small. Reflux into the proper, right and left hepatic arteries was also
     present.
     
     Using an 0.035 angled glidewire, it was possible to advance the C2 glidecath

   pt is an unfortuate 75yob man who was recently dx w/invasive adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. he was in his usoh on [**2-25**] when he developed some nausea and hematemesis. he was initially admitted to medicine and received 2u prbc's and was seen by gi. he underwent an initial egd which did not reveal any active bleeding. however, on [**2-27**], the pt developed more hematemesis and had brbpr x1; a second egd did show brisk hemobilia and he was subsequently taken to angio. he received another 2u prbc's yesterday before and during angio. in angio, his right hepatic pseudoaneurysm was thrombosed and three coils were placed. this was the second time this year that this pseudoaneurysm bled and required intervention. the pt was admitted to the micu for observation post procedure overnoc. 

pmh: invasive adenocarcinoma of the gb w/pt now receiving pallative chemotherapy (5fu/lekovorin-> pt has received 2 cycles); common bile duct stent placed during ercp; typeII dm; s/p appy; svt/afib now on amiodarone
