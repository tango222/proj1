HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male
with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension,
coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction,
chronic renal insufficiency who presented to [**Hospital6 283**] on [**3279-4-10**] for
catheterization for management of a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction.  He presented from an outside
hospital.  He initially presented to an outside hospital in
St. [**Doctor Last Name **] while on vacation with a left hip fracture.  While
at this outside hospital he flashed, having pulmonary edema
requiring intubation times one day.  There he ruled in for
myocardial infarction with a positive troponin.  He denied
chest pain, palpitations and loss of consciousness, only
positive for shortness of breath.  He presented to CMED on
[**3279-4-10**] and was catheterized on [**3279-4-12**].  Right
atrium 12, mean right ventricle 55/14, pulmonary airway
55/25, wedge 27, mid right coronary artery discrete 80%,
distal right coronary artery discrete 80%, both of these
lesions had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
and stent.  Left main diffusely diseased 70%, mid left
anterior descending discrete 100%, collateral from an right
posterior descending artery.  Distal left anterior descending
diffusely diseased, collateral from an right posterior
descending artery.  Proximal circumflex discrete 60% lesion.
Overall impression, three vessel coronary artery disease,
status post successful stenting times two of the right
coronary artery, moderate systolic biventricular dysfunction,
elevated systolic pressure.  Echocardiogram on [**3279-4-12**],

depression in 2, 3, and AVF, ST flattening in 1 and AVL, rate
sinus at 85, prolonged at 160, QRS at 70, QTC 416, normal
axis.  Also on the note of the patient's cardiac
catheterization, cardiac output was 3.3, index was 2, SVR was
1891.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reports stable exertional
angina over several years, relieved with nitroglycerin.  He
has occasional nocturnal angina.  He has been chest pain free
since arrival.  Positive for fatigue.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for diabetes, 12 year history,
very brittle.  Hypertension.  Coronary artery disease with
the posterior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  Chronic
renal insufficiency.  Distant seizure disorder, has not had
seizure for 40 years, status post prostatectomy, status post
right hip replacement, gastroesophageal reflux disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former composer of music.  He lives
with his wife at [**Name2 (NI) 1849**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home include
Atenolol, Altace, Dilantin, Zantac and Insulin.  Medications
on transfer to CCU were Aspirin 325 q.d., Lopressor 25
b.i.d., Captopril 6.25 b.i.d., Dilantin 200 q. AM, 100 q. PM,
Protonix 40 q.d., Percocet, regular insulin sliding scale and
Mucomyst 600 b.i.d. times two days, insulin Lente 16 units q.
AM.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation
to the CCU, the patient was lying in bed in no acute
distress.  Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  No oral
lesions.  Jugulovenous distension, angle of the mandible.
Lungs clear to auscultation, anteriorly in the upper lung
fields, decreased breathsounds laterally.  The patient was
unable to sit forward secondary to pain from his hip
fracture.  He had regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  He had
a high-pitched systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal
border.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  +1 dorsalis pedis pulses, no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  He has a deformity of the right hand.
Groin, no hematoma or bruit. Cranial nerves III through XII
intact.  Alert and oriented times three.  Good strength in
all of his extremities except for a broken leg, unable to
move it secondary to leg pain.

LABORATORY DATA:  On [**3279-4-11**], he had hematocrit of 32,
white blood cell count of 12.5, hemoglobin 10.6, platelets
152, sodium 135, potassium 4.8, chloride 100, bicarbonate 22,
BUN 57, creatinine 2.2.  His baseline seems to be
approximately 1.9 to 2.1, magnesium 1.9, calcium 8.3,
phosphorus 4.2, ALT 51, AST 21, alkaline phosphatase 201,
total bilirubin .3, INR 1.1.  On [**3279-4-11**], showed
ejection fraction 25%, gradient 41 mm of mercury, right
atrium normal size, left ventricular wall thickness was
normal, left ventricular cavity size was normal.  Overall
left ventricular function is severely depressed.  No resting
systolic outflow obstruction.  Right ventricular chamber
size, free wall motion is normal.  +1 mitral regurgitation,
although the acoustic shadow, the severity of this may be
significantly underestimated, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation,
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  So, the patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with
a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic renal
insufficiency who presents from an outside hospital with left
hip fracture, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction,
resulting in congestive heart failure and status post
extubation, status post catheterization showing increased
filling pressures and right coronary artery with stent times
two.

1.  Cardiology - Coronary artery disease, the patient had two
right coronary artery stents.  His left system was totally
occluded.  He fills collaterals from the right system from
the posterior descending artery.  The patient in the future
may benefit from left-sided intervention to open up the left
anterior descending as he is dependent on a stented vessel
for flow of both his left and right systems.  The patient
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient, his
cardiologist.  The patient was continued on Aspirin, Plavix.
He was initially on Lopressor b.i.d.  This was ramped up to
50 b.i.d. with improved control of his heartrate going from
high 80s to 90s to mid 70s.  The patient initially was on
6.25 of Captopril.  This was increased as high as 37.5 but
then discontinued and the patient experienced acute renal
failure, thought secondary to dye-induced nephropathy
approximately 48 hours after his cardiac catheterization.
The patient initially was on the Nitroglycerin and Integrilin
drip status post catheterization.  These both were turned off
by 18 hours after the catheterization.

Congestive heart failure, the patient initially presented
from the Catheterization Laboratory in congestive heart
failure with recent intubation with elevated jugulovenous
pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in
Catheterization Laboratory and bilateral pleural effusions
with an ejection fraction of 25%.  He was diuresed with
Lasix, initially printing out to 80 intravenously.  Blood
pressure was said to be fine, overloaded and eventually did
not respond to further increasing doses of Lasix until again
he had initial course complicated by acute renal failure.
The patient had dialysis times two which helped remove fluid
and improve his volume status, greatly improving the
congestive heart failure that he had been experiencing.

Rhythm, the patient was on telemetry.  He for the most part
had a normal sinus rhythm but in the contest of hyperkalemia
he had a wide complex rhythm with PTT waves, flattened Ps and
a prolonged PR interval.  The patient received four gm of
intravenous calcium gluconate, 30 mg of Kayexalate and
insulin drip which reduced his potassium from a level of 7.2
to 5.6 and resolving his electrocardiogram changes.  The
patient had hemodialysis later that day which further
improved his potassium levels as well as his acidosis and his
volume status.  As outpatient has mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation as per his echocardiogram.

Renal - As stated previously above, the patient had renal
failure with his creatinine to 4.9, baseline is 2.2 and his
potassium going to 7.2.  The patient had bicarbonate of 15 as
well.  Renal saw the patient, it was felt that his renal
dysfunction was the result of dye-induced nephropathy.  The
patient had Quinton catheter placed at the bedside.  This
improved and he had dialysis through his catheter.  This
improved his creatinine to 3.3 with further improvement to
2.9 and then 1.9 being 1.9 the night before discharge without
dialysis.  The patient only had dialysis twice and had
improvement of his renal function with resolution of the
temporary dye-induced nephropathy.  The patient had received
intravenous fluids, Mucomyst peri-catheterization but still
had dye-induced nephropathy.

Heme - The patient had hematocrit on [**4-11**] of 32.  He had a
hematocrit drop from 29.6 to 21.5 on [**4-16**].  The patient
was guaiac negative times two.  Post having his dialysis
placed as well as internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter placed,
he had computerized axial tomography scan of the abdomen and
chest which showed no retroperitoneal or mediastinal bleed.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and
increased his hematocrit to 29 and with dialysis the patient
then received 2 more units prior to his hip surgery as well
as dialysis to remove excess fluid with increase in his
hematocrit to 39.  This decreased to 27.5 two days
postoperatively and he received 1 unit of packed red blood
cells on the night prior to discharge.

Orthopedics - The patient was followed by the Orthopedics
Team and greatly appreciated.  The patient had a left open
reduction and internal fixation of his fractured hip.  On
[**4-18**], he had this surgery by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 5166**].  The
patient tolerated this surgery well.  Prior to his renal
failure he had been on Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously q. day as
well as pneuma boots for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
with renal failure.  This was discontinued and he was started
on 5000 units of subcutaneous heparin t.i.d., status post the
surgery as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5166**].  The patient was started on a low
dose Coumadin 2 mg q.h.s. with a goal INR of 1.5 to 2.  When
he reaches his goal INR of 1.5, the subcutaneous heparin will
be discontinued.  The patient currently is undergoing
physical therapy here in the CCU.  He will require [**Hospital 364**]
rehabilitation for improvement of his mobility.  He is able
to bear weight on his leg.

Anticoagulation - The patient has apical AK on his
echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of less than 25%,
however, this is secondary to an old anterior myocardial
infarction and not an acute event, therefore he would not
benefit from anticoagulation as thrombus prevention as this
is an old lesion and the risk is in the acute setting of an
anterior myocardial infarction.  As per above, the patient
will be receiving the low dose Coumadin for deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis.

Diabetes - The patient was seen by the [**Hospital1 6144**] Service who
assisted in the management of his very brittle diabetes.  The
patient was on an insulin drip prior to his surgery and
postoperative finally able to be removed from the drip on
[**3279-4-20**].  He is on a sliding scale as per [**Hospital1 6144**], a
little higher levels of Humalog.  This will be accompanying
his discharge paperwork.  The patient also is on Lente, now
starting on [**4-21**] through [**4-26**] in AM.  This will be
titrated up to 20 as he requires insulin control.  At the
current time, he ranged between 71 and 343, being very
brittle.  I just hope with titration as above his AM dose of
Lente, we can get better control.

Neurological - The patient has a very distant seizure
history.  His Dilantin level was .16 after dialysis.  He was
reloaded with 1 gm p.o. Dilantin divided in three doses and
then placed back on his 200 q. AM, 100 q.h.s. Dilantin with
no seizure activity witnessed.

Prophylaxis - The patient received initially Lovenox then
switched to subcutaneous heparin t.i.d. with pneuma boot as
well as being changed to low dose Coumadin when the patient
is above an INR of 1.5.  His .................. will be
discontinued in favor of the low dose Coumadin, it is helpful
that the patient is beginning to ambulate with physical
therapy.  He is also on Protonix for gastrointestinal
prophylaxis.  He is a full code.

The patient had agitation at night and was tried on 1 mg p.o.
b.i.d. of Haldol, the patient was very sedated.  When his
Haldol as well as Morphine was discontinued his mental status
improved.   He had Percocet for pain control related to
physical therapy but the patient should not receive more than
one pill at a time unless in extreme pain as he has had
decreased mental status and somnolence with narcotics and
Haldol.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       [**Age over 90 **] year old man with MI multiple attempts to place a central line 
      unsuccessfully                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Check for pneumothorax                                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Status post multiple attempts to place central line. Evaluate for
     pneumothorax.
     
     A single frontal semi upright portable chest radiograph is compared with prior
     study dated [**3279-4-10**].
     
     No pneumothorax is identified on this single view though the patient's chin
     obscures both apices.  The heart size is stable with a mild left ventricular
     configuration. A density in the retrocardiac region raises suspicion of a
     hiatal hernia.  There has been interval improvement in mild congestive heart
     failure.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  An apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded in this markedly
     kyphotic patient with chin overlying the apices.  If clinical concern for
     pneumothorax is high, consider decubitus film, with the side of concern
     nondependent.
     
     Improving congestive heart failure.

     following central line placement.  Assess for groin or retroperitoneal
     hematoma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
     through the mid thighs without intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  A 1.7 x 1.0 cm pretracheal lymph node is
     present.  No other pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
     lymph nodes are identified.  There is extensive calcification of the coronary
     arteries and ascending and descending portions of the aorta.  There are
     moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectatic
     changes.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Allowing for the limitations of a non-
     contrast examination, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys are
     unremarkable.  There are calcifications of both renal artereis. Bilateral low
     density small adrenal masses are present, most likely representing adenomas.
     The unopacified loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable. There is no
     evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are extensive calcifications of
     both iliac arteries.  There is considerable artifact from a right hip
     prosthesis.  Allowing for this, no inguinal hematoma is identified.  The
     pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable.  The urinary bladder is not well seen.

     evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are extensive calcifications of
     both iliac arteries.  There is considerable artifact from a right hip
     prosthesis.  Allowing for this, no inguinal hematoma is identified.  The
     pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable.  The urinary bladder is not well seen.

     HISTORY:  Line placement.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST, ONE VIEW:  Comparison [**3279-4-20**].  Since the prior exam, the
     right subclavian line has been removed and there has been interval placement
     of a right subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter with tip in the right main pulmonary
     artery.  This should be slightly withdrawn.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
     is an NG tube extending into the stomach, tip not visualized.  The heart is
     normal in size.  The lungs are grossly clear.  There is improvement in the
     previously seen pulmonary edema.  There is blunting of the lateral CP angles
     which likely reflects small residual effusions.  There is associated
     atelectasis at the bases.  There is no definite focal pneumonia.  The
     patient's chin obscures portions of the apices but there is likely biapical
     pleural thickening, unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Right Swan-Ganz catheter with tip in the right main pulmonary artery.  No
     pneumothorax.
     2) Improvement in pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and
     atelectasis at the bases.

     The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified 2 cm above the carina. A
     nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The right subclavian IV catheter
     terminates in the superior vena cava.
     
     There is increased congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and bilateral
     pleural effusions.  There is increased patchy atelectasis in both lower lobes.
     The opacity especially in the right lung could be due to superimposed
     aspiration or pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is identified, although the apices
     are obscured by the supine posed mandible.

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 6546**] year old male with respiratory failure, recent MI, DKA, and
     anemia with right upper quadrant tenderness.  Evaluate for cholecystitis. 
      
     DECISION:  1.3 mg of Morphine was administered after nonvisualization of the 
     gallbladder occurred after 90 minutes.  Additional imaging was obtained 30
     minutes following the administration of Morphine. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Serial images obtained over the abdomen show normal uptake of
     tracer into the hepatic parenchyma.  After 90 minutes, the gallbladder was not
     visualized.  1.3 mg of Morphine was administered at that point.  After an
     additional 30 minutes, no tracer activity within the gallbladder was visualized.
      
     The above findings are consistent with nonvisualization of the gallbladder.

     INDICATION:  Respiratory failure and intubation.  Evauate for lung
     consolidation or CHF.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a prior study from the previous day.
     
     There is an ET tube approximately 2 cm above the carina.  There is a left-
     sided subclavian line in satisfactory position with its distal tip in the mid
     SVC.  There has been interval removal of a right-sided subclavian line.  The
     heart size is enlarged and stable when compared to the prior exams.  The
     mediastinal contours are stable.  There are bilateral pleural effusions.  Both
     lung bases are obscured by likely effusion and/or posslbe ill defined
     infiltrates.  Allowing for position, there is slightly worsening promince of
     the pulmonary vasculature, suggesting slightly worsening pulmonary edema.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Interval removal of right-sided subclavian line with no evidence of
     pneumothorax.
     
     2. ET tube 2 cm above the carina.
     
     3. Allowing for the patient's supine position, there is slightly worsening
     bilateral ill defined infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.
     
     4. There is an unchanged appearance of bilateral pleural effusions and ill
     defined infiltrate at the lung bases.

Pt was transported down to Flouroscopy in his bed for insertion of feeding tube which was unsuccessful. He continues to have no access for PO meds and all meds have been switched to IV for now. Plan is for discussions with his wife over the WE for possible PEG insertion early next week. In the meantime they may restart his TPN but he does not have a clean port any more and would need to have the triple lumen changed over a wire.

He continues to have runs of SVT/Rapid a-fib and is now on lopressor around the clock. His sats have [**Last Name (un) 3014**] good. He remains on 40% CN with 2L N/C. Lungs are coarse and pt has junky productive cough. Attempts to NT suction him have not been very successful today.

     INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with suspected aspiration.
     
     TECHNIQUE: A video oropharyngeal swallow was performed in conjunction with the
     speech and swallow division.
     
     FINDINGS: Various consistencies of barium meal were administered to the
     patient. During the oral phase, the patient demonstrated moderately reduced
     bolus formation and control with increased oral transit times and mild oral
     residue on the soft palate and tongue base. Premature spillover of liquids was
     observed into the valleculae and piriform sinuses. During the pharyngeal
     phase, normal epiglottic deflection and laryngeal elevation were observed.
     Initially, the patient demonstrated laryngeal penetration and was aspirating
     trace amounts of nectar and ground consistencies secondary to residue from
     pharynx. The swallow function subsequently deteriorated to the point where he
     silently aspirated various consistencies. Acute cough was ineffective in
     clearing aspirated material from the trachea.
     
     IMPRESSION: Silent aspiration of various consistencies. Please refer to the
     speech and swallow consultation noted and recommendations.

      [**Age over 90 **] year old man with                                                            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please eval for subacute infarct for mildly improved mental status              
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Improved mental status changes, evaluate for subacute infarct.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2, susceptibility, FLAIR and diffusion weighted
     images were obtained through the brain. 3D time of flight MR angiography of
     the circle of [**Location (un) 309**] was also performed, with multiplanar reformations.
     
     MR BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST: On the diffusion weighted images, there is a focus
     of increased signal intensity in the high right parietal lobe. There is also a
     focus of increased signal intensity in the high left frontoparietal region,
     near the sylvian fissure. These areas correspond to foci of increased signal
     intensity on T1 weighted images as well as the FLAIR images. There is also
     another small focus of increased signal intensity on the T1 weighted and FLAIR
     images more posteriorly, in the right parietal lobe. There is no mass effect
     or shift of normally midline structures. There is no hydrocephalus. There is
     increased signal intensity in the mastoid air cells bilaterally as well as the
     ethmoid and sphenoid air cells. There may be air fluid levels in the maxillary
     sinuses bilaterally.
     
     Circle of [**Location (un) 309**] MRA: The vessels are widely patent, without evidence for
     stenosis, aneurysmal dilatation, or arterial venous malformations.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Unusual foci of increased signal intensity at the periphery of
     the brain bilaterally, as described above. Small foci of hemorrhage cannot be
     excluded. Alternatively, these findings could be consistent with prominent
     vessels or calcified meningiomas. Correlation with a non-contrast head CT is
     recommended. 2. Normal circle of [**Location (un) 309**] MRA.
