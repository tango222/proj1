Admission Date:  [**3427-3-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**3427-4-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**3356-3-25**]     Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

The patient is a 71-year-old male who was an unrestrained
driver in a high speed motor vehicle crash.  The passenger
was side T-boned.  By report, the patient self extricated,
took a few steps, and collapsed. He was unable to be
intubated in the field and was only responding to pain.
Initially, his systolic blood pressure was 130.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] and intubated successfully.
Evaluation there, he has a blown pupil, a large pelvic
fracture, a negative C spine series, and negative chest
x-ray.

While at that hospital, he dropped his blood pressure into
the 50's.  IV was started.  Red blood cells was started, and
the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 73**] for further management.  The patient arrived at [**Hospital1 930**] hemodynamically unstable.  He
was fluid and volume resuscitated with packed red blood
cells, plasma products.  As part of his initial trauma
workup, the patient had numerous injuries discovered and
these included multiple rib fractures, bilateral
pneumothoraces and hemothoraces, subarachnoid hemorrhage with
interventricular extension, lateral mass fractures of C6, C2,
and lamina fractures of C6 and C7, pneumomediastinum,
multiple pelvic fractures, which included the iliac [**Doctor First Name 114**] in
the inferior-superior pubic rami.

Because of the patient's hemodynamic instability and pelvic
fractures, the patient was taken immediately to angiography
following his initial trauma resuscitation and imaging
workup.  His coagulopathy was corrected and at angiography a
right inferior epigastric vessel was embolized successfully.

Following angiography the patient was transferred to the
Trauma SICU.  From hospital day one to hospital day two
overnight, the patient developed an abdominal compartment
syndrome.  For this, he returned to the operating room for an
exploratory laparotomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

No frank bleeding was discovered within his abdomen.  There
was, however, a large stable retroperitoneal hematoma.  The
patient's abdomen was left abdomen.  He was returned to the
Trauma Intensive Care Unit.  Additionally, during this
procedure, the Neurosurgical service was consulted for
intraoperative placement of a ventricular catheter.

The following day on hospital day two, the Neurosurgery
service again saw the patient, and performed a cerebral
angiogram.  There is no evidence of carotid injury.  The
patient remained intubated and sedated in the Intensive Care
Unit following these procedures.

On [**3427-4-3**], the patient had a MRI which demonstrated
evidence of cortical hemorrhages consistent with diffuse
axonal injury and no enlarged infarction.  The patient
remained intubated and sedated in the Intensive Care Unit
without change in his neurologic examination until the date
of 03/17 when his abdomen was again closed.

For the next week, the Neurosurgery service continued to see
the patient daily.  There was really very minimal resolution
in his neurologic examination.  He is noted to have at times
decerebrate posturing some spontaneous eye opening, but was
never able to follow commands.  He is also noted to be moving
on his left side.  Throughout his hospitalization, the
Neurosurgical service felt that his prognosis for recovery
was very poor.

From a Trauma Surgical standpoint, the patient remained
relatively stable requiring minimal amounts of blood
products.  Was maintained on maintenance fluid as well as
antibiotics and TPN throughout his hospital course.

On [**3427-4-14**], following discussions with the family, which had
been ongoing for several days with the Neurosurgery service's
feeling that there is very minimal chance of recovery, the
family at this point decided to withdraw care.

On [**3427-4-14**], tube feedings and supportive care were stopped.
The patient expired shortly thereafter.  The patient was
pronounced dead at 13:06 by Trauma SICU staff approximately
one hour after extubation.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      locate pelvic bleeding and coiling as identified                                
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: This patient is a 71 year old male status post recent motor
     vehicle collision with pelvic fracture and hypotension. Pre-angio CAT scan of
     the abdomen and pelvis revealed a pelvic fracture (left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] and foramen
     obturator) and pelvic hematoma with active contrast extravasation close to the
     left pubic ramus fracture. Also cranial trauma with intraventricular
     hemorrhage, multi-level cervical spine fractures, and rib fractures and
     bilateral chest tubes.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5486**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5487**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] d'Othee. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present for and supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE & FINDINGS: The patient was placed in a supine position on the
     fluoroscopy table. The right groin was shaved, prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner. A right femoral venous Cordis catheter was in place prior to
     arrival at the angiography suite. Fluoroscopic guidance was used to identify
     the region of the common femoral artery overlying the lower edge of the
     femoral head. A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was made with an 11 blade. A 19 gauge single
     wall puncture needle was introduced into the right common femoral artery. An
     0.035 inch Bentson guidewire was introduced and advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance to the level of the lower abdominal aorta. The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French sheath. The sidearm of the sheath was continuously flushed with
     heparinized saline throughout the entirety of the case. Over the Bentson
     guidewire a 5 French OmniFlush catheter was inserted and positioned at the
     level of the third lumbar vertebra. An AP pelvic arteriogram was performed and
     revealed evidence of contrast extravasation from an arterial branch overlying
     the left femoral head.
     An 0.035 inch angled glidewire was inserted and guided across the aortic
     bifurcation into the left internal iliac artery. The OmniFlush catheter was
     advanced into the left internal iliac artery and a selective left hypogastric
     artery arteriogram was performed. No extravasation was noted.
     Using the angled glidewire the Omni Flush catheter was redirected into the
     left external iliac artery and a selective left external iliac arteriogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed revealing rapid, free extravasation of contrast from a small medial
     arterial branch arising from the junction of the left external iliac and
     common femoral arteries. This branch was believed to be a branch of the
     left inferior epigastric artery, as its medial take-off was at the same
     craniocaudal level as the origin of the left superficial circumflex iliac
     artery (laterally).
     The Omni Flush catheter was exchanged for a 5 French C2 catheter, the tip of
     which was positioned in front of this small arterial branch. Given the small
     size of this branch, a Tracker microcatheter and wire were inserted coaxially
     through the C2 catheter and an 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the small
     arterial branch. After a short medial segment, this branch bifurcated into a
     long vertical branch flowing cranially and a short infero-medial branch. The
     former was believed to be the left inferior epigastric artery, the latter was
     the branch where the bleeding originated.
     The Tracker microcatheter was advanced selectively over the 0.018 wire into
     the bleeding branch under fluoroscopic guidance. Hand injection of contrast
     through the microcatheter was performed under fluoroscopy and confirmed
     correct position of the catheter tip. Two 0.018 x 2 mm diameter x 2 cm long
     coils were deployed successively.
     A superselective contrast injection through the microcatheter was repeated and
     the corresponding arteriogram revealed no evidence of contrast extravasation
     after coil deployment, with stagnant flow in the embolized branch and reflux
     into the left external iliac artery.
     The Tracker catheter was removed and a follow-up arteriogram of the left
     external iliac artery was performed through the Cobra C2 catheter. The
     previously bleeding arterial branch is identified approximately 1 cm in length
     after which point no contrast filling of this branch and no free extravasation
     of contrast is noted.
     The C2 catheter was removed. The right 5 French femoral arterial sheath was
     left in place and sutured with 0 Prolene to the skin, in agreement with the
     Trauma Team.
     The patient had episodes of hypotension throughout the case. He was intubated
     prior to arrival and maintained on a ventilator throughout the case.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received a total of 90 cc of non ionic
     contrast (Optiray 320) throughout the case. He also received a total of 225
     micrograms of Fentanyl IV and 1 mg of Versed IV under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful microcoil embolization of a bleeding arterial branch,
     likely a branch of the inferior epigastric artery. No complications were
     noted.
     The patient was transported by the trauma team to the trauma intensive care
     unit after the procedure with the sheath in place.

      71 year old man s/p MVC hypotensive w pelvic fractures                          
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      locate pelvic bleeding and coiling as identified                                
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: This patient is a 71 year old male status post recent motor
     vehicle collision with pelvic fracture and hypotension. Pre-angio CAT scan of
     the abdomen and pelvis revealed a pelvic fracture (left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] and foramen
     obturator) and pelvic hematoma with active contrast extravasation close to the
     left pubic ramus fracture. Also cranial trauma with intraventricular
     hemorrhage, multi-level cervical spine fractures, and rib fractures and
     bilateral chest tubes.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5486**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5487**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] d'Othee. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present for and supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE & FINDINGS: The patient was placed in a supine position on the
     fluoroscopy table. The right groin was shaved, prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner. A right femoral venous Cordis catheter was in place prior to
     arrival at the angiography suite. Fluoroscopic guidance was used to identify
     the region of the common femoral artery overlying the lower edge of the
     femoral head. A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was made with an 11 blade. A 19 gauge single
     wall puncture needle was introduced into the right common femoral artery. An
     0.035 inch Bentson guidewire was introduced and advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance to the level of the lower abdominal aorta. The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French sheath. The sidearm of the sheath was continuously flushed with
     heparinized saline throughout the entirety of the case. Over the Bentson
     guidewire a 5 French OmniFlush catheter was inserted and positioned at the
     level of the third lumbar vertebra. An AP pelvic arteriogram was performed and
     revealed evidence of contrast extravasation from an arterial branch overlying
     the left femoral head.
     An 0.035 inch angled glidewire was inserted and guided across the aortic
     bifurcation into the left internal iliac artery. The OmniFlush catheter was
     advanced into the left internal iliac artery and a selective left hypogastric
     artery arteriogram was performed. No extravasation was noted.
     Using the angled glidewire the Omni Flush catheter was redirected into the
     left external iliac artery and a selective left external iliac arteriogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed revealing rapid, free extravasation of contrast from a small medial
     arterial branch arising from the junction of the left external iliac and
     common femoral arteries. This branch was believed to be a branch of the
     left inferior epigastric artery, as its medial take-off was at the same
     craniocaudal level as the origin of the left superficial circumflex iliac
     artery (laterally).
     The Omni Flush catheter was exchanged for a 5 French C2 catheter, the tip of
     which was positioned in front of this small arterial branch. Given the small
     size of this branch, a Tracker microcatheter and wire were inserted coaxially
     through the C2 catheter and an 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the small
     arterial branch. After a short medial segment, this branch bifurcated into a
     long vertical branch flowing cranially and a short infero-medial branch. The
     former was believed to be the left inferior epigastric artery, the latter was
     the branch where the bleeding originated.
     The Tracker microcatheter was advanced selectively over the 0.018 wire into
     the bleeding branch under fluoroscopic guidance. Hand injection of contrast
     through the microcatheter was performed under fluoroscopy and confirmed
     correct position of the catheter tip. Two 0.018 x 2 mm diameter x 2 cm long
     coils were deployed successively.
     A superselective contrast injection through the microcatheter was repeated and
     the corresponding arteriogram revealed no evidence of contrast extravasation
     after coil deployment, with stagnant flow in the embolized branch and reflux
     into the left external iliac artery.
     The Tracker catheter was removed and a follow-up arteriogram of the left
     external iliac artery was performed through the Cobra C2 catheter. The
     previously bleeding arterial branch is identified approximately 1 cm in length
     after which point no contrast filling of this branch and no free extravasation
     of contrast is noted.
     The C2 catheter was removed. The right 5 French femoral arterial sheath was
     left in place and sutured with 0 Prolene to the skin, in agreement with the
     Trauma Team.
     The patient had episodes of hypotension throughout the case. He was intubated
     prior to arrival and maintained on a ventilator throughout the case.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received a total of 90 cc of non ionic
     contrast (Optiray 320) throughout the case. He also received a total of 225
     micrograms of Fentanyl IV and 1 mg of Versed IV under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful microcoil embolization of a bleeding arterial branch,
     likely a branch of the inferior epigastric artery. No complications were
     noted.
     The patient was transported by the trauma team to the trauma intensive care
     unit after the procedure with the sheath in place.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION: This patient is a 71 year old male status post recent motor
     vehicle collision with pelvic fracture and hypotension. Pre-angio CAT scan of
     the abdomen and pelvis revealed a pelvic fracture (left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] and foramen
     obturator) and pelvic hematoma with active contrast extravasation close to the
     left pubic ramus fracture. Also cranial trauma with intraventricular
     hemorrhage, multi-level cervical spine fractures, and rib fractures and
     bilateral chest tubes.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5486**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5487**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] d'Othee. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present for and supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE & FINDINGS: The patient was placed in a supine position on the
     fluoroscopy table. The right groin was shaved, prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner. A right femoral venous Cordis catheter was in place prior to
     arrival at the angiography suite. Fluoroscopic guidance was used to identify
     the region of the common femoral artery overlying the lower edge of the
     femoral head. A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was made with an 11 blade. A 19 gauge single
     wall puncture needle was introduced into the right common femoral artery. An
     0.035 inch Bentson guidewire was introduced and advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance to the level of the lower abdominal aorta. The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French sheath. The sidearm of the sheath was continuously flushed with
     heparinized saline throughout the entirety of the case. Over the Bentson
     guidewire a 5 French OmniFlush catheter was inserted and positioned at the
     level of the third lumbar vertebra. An AP pelvic arteriogram was performed and
     revealed evidence of contrast extravasation from an arterial branch overlying

     performed revealing rapid, free extravasation of contrast from a small medial
     arterial branch arising from the junction of the left external iliac and
     common femoral arteries. This branch was believed to be a branch of the
     left inferior epigastric artery, as its medial take-off was at the same
     craniocaudal level as the origin of the left superficial circumflex iliac
     artery (laterally).
     The Omni Flush catheter was exchanged for a 5 French C2 catheter, the tip of
     which was positioned in front of this small arterial branch. Given the small
     size of this branch, a Tracker microcatheter and wire were inserted coaxially
     through the C2 catheter and an 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the small
     arterial branch. After a short medial segment, this branch bifurcated into a
     long vertical branch flowing cranially and a short infero-medial branch. The
     former was believed to be the left inferior epigastric artery, the latter was
     the branch where the bleeding originated.
     The Tracker microcatheter was advanced selectively over the 0.018 wire into
     the bleeding branch under fluoroscopic guidance. Hand injection of contrast
     through the microcatheter was performed under fluoroscopy and confirmed
     correct position of the catheter tip. Two 0.018 x 2 mm diameter x 2 cm long
     coils were deployed successively.
     A superselective contrast injection through the microcatheter was repeated and
     the corresponding arteriogram revealed no evidence of contrast extravasation
     after coil deployment, with stagnant flow in the embolized branch and reflux
     into the left external iliac artery.
     The Tracker catheter was removed and a follow-up arteriogram of the left
     external iliac artery was performed through the Cobra C2 catheter. The
     previously bleeding arterial branch is identified approximately 1 cm in length
     after which point no contrast filling of this branch and no free extravasation
     of contrast is noted.
     The C2 catheter was removed. The right 5 French femoral arterial sheath was
     left in place and sutured with 0 Prolene to the skin, in agreement with the
     Trauma Team.
     The patient had episodes of hypotension throughout the case. He was intubated
     prior to arrival and maintained on a ventilator throughout the case.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received a total of 90 cc of non ionic
     contrast (Optiray 320) throughout the case. He also received a total of 225
     micrograms of Fentanyl IV and 1 mg of Versed IV under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful microcoil embolization of a bleeding arterial branch,
     likely a branch of the inferior epigastric artery. No complications were
     noted.
     The patient was transported by the trauma team to the trauma intensive care
     unit after the procedure with the sheath in place.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: This patient is a 71 year old male status post recent motor
     vehicle collision with pelvic fracture and hypotension. Pre-angio CAT scan of
     the abdomen and pelvis revealed a pelvic fracture (left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] and foramen
     obturator) and pelvic hematoma with active contrast extravasation close to the
     left pubic ramus fracture. Also cranial trauma with intraventricular
     hemorrhage, multi-level cervical spine fractures, and rib fractures and
     bilateral chest tubes.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5486**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5487**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] d'Othee. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present for and supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE & FINDINGS: The patient was placed in a supine position on the
     fluoroscopy table. The right groin was shaved, prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner. A right femoral venous Cordis catheter was in place prior to
     arrival at the angiography suite. Fluoroscopic guidance was used to identify
     the region of the common femoral artery overlying the lower edge of the
     femoral head. A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was made with an 11 blade. A 19 gauge single
     wall puncture needle was introduced into the right common femoral artery. An
     0.035 inch Bentson guidewire was introduced and advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance to the level of the lower abdominal aorta. The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French sheath. The sidearm of the sheath was continuously flushed with
     heparinized saline throughout the entirety of the case. Over the Bentson
     guidewire a 5 French OmniFlush catheter was inserted and positioned at the
     level of the third lumbar vertebra. An AP pelvic arteriogram was performed and
     revealed evidence of contrast extravasation from an arterial branch overlying
     the left femoral head.
     An 0.035 inch angled glidewire was inserted and guided across the aortic
     bifurcation into the left internal iliac artery. The OmniFlush catheter was

     INDICATION: This patient is a 71 year old male status post recent motor
     vehicle collision with pelvic fracture and hypotension. Pre-angio CAT scan of
     the abdomen and pelvis revealed a pelvic fracture (left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] and foramen
     obturator) and pelvic hematoma with active contrast extravasation close to the
     left pubic ramus fracture. Also cranial trauma with intraventricular
     hemorrhage, multi-level cervical spine fractures, and rib fractures and
     bilateral chest tubes.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5486**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5487**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] d'Othee. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present for and supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE & FINDINGS: The patient was placed in a supine position on the
     fluoroscopy table. The right groin was shaved, prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner. A right femoral venous Cordis catheter was in place prior to
     arrival at the angiography suite. Fluoroscopic guidance was used to identify
     the region of the common femoral artery overlying the lower edge of the
     femoral head. A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was made with an 11 blade. A 19 gauge single
     wall puncture needle was introduced into the right common femoral artery. An
     0.035 inch Bentson guidewire was introduced and advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance to the level of the lower abdominal aorta. The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French sheath. The sidearm of the sheath was continuously flushed with
     heparinized saline throughout the entirety of the case. Over the Bentson
     guidewire a 5 French OmniFlush catheter was inserted and positioned at the
     level of the third lumbar vertebra. An AP pelvic arteriogram was performed and
     revealed evidence of contrast extravasation from an arterial branch overlying
     the left femoral head.
     An 0.035 inch angled glidewire was inserted and guided across the aortic
     bifurcation into the left internal iliac artery. The OmniFlush catheter was
     advanced into the left internal iliac artery and a selective left hypogastric
     artery arteriogram was performed. No extravasation was noted.
     Using the angled glidewire the Omni Flush catheter was redirected into the
     left external iliac artery and a selective left external iliac arteriogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed revealing rapid, free extravasation of contrast from a small medial
     arterial branch arising from the junction of the left external iliac and
     common femoral arteries. This branch was believed to be a branch of the
     left inferior epigastric artery, as its medial take-off was at the same
     craniocaudal level as the origin of the left superficial circumflex iliac
     artery (laterally).
     The Omni Flush catheter was exchanged for a 5 French C2 catheter, the tip of
     which was positioned in front of this small arterial branch. Given the small
     size of this branch, a Tracker microcatheter and wire were inserted coaxially
     through the C2 catheter and an 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the small
     arterial branch. After a short medial segment, this branch bifurcated into a
     long vertical branch flowing cranially and a short infero-medial branch. The
     former was believed to be the left inferior epigastric artery, the latter was
     the branch where the bleeding originated.
     The Tracker microcatheter was advanced selectively over the 0.018 wire into
     the bleeding branch under fluoroscopic guidance. Hand injection of contrast
     through the microcatheter was performed under fluoroscopy and confirmed
     correct position of the catheter tip. Two 0.018 x 2 mm diameter x 2 cm long
     coils were deployed successively.
     A superselective contrast injection through the microcatheter was repeated and
     the corresponding arteriogram revealed no evidence of contrast extravasation
     after coil deployment, with stagnant flow in the embolized branch and reflux
     into the left external iliac artery.
     The Tracker catheter was removed and a follow-up arteriogram of the left
     external iliac artery was performed through the Cobra C2 catheter. The
     previously bleeding arterial branch is identified approximately 1 cm in length
     after which point no contrast filling of this branch and no free extravasation
     of contrast is noted.
     The C2 catheter was removed. The right 5 French femoral arterial sheath was
     left in place and sutured with 0 Prolene to the skin, in agreement with the
     Trauma Team.
     The patient had episodes of hypotension throughout the case. He was intubated
     prior to arrival and maintained on a ventilator throughout the case.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received a total of 90 cc of non ionic
     contrast (Optiray 320) throughout the case. He also received a total of 225
     micrograms of Fentanyl IV and 1 mg of Versed IV under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful microcoil embolization of a bleeding arterial branch,
     likely a branch of the inferior epigastric artery. No complications were
     noted.
     The patient was transported by the trauma team to the trauma intensive care
     unit after the procedure with the sheath in place.
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      71 year old man s/p MVC hypotensive w pelvic fractures                          
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      locate pelvic bleeding and coiling as identified                                
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: This patient is a 71 year old male status post recent motor
     vehicle collision with pelvic fracture and hypotension. Pre-angio CAT scan of
     the abdomen and pelvis revealed a pelvic fracture (left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] and foramen
     obturator) and pelvic hematoma with active contrast extravasation close to the
     left pubic ramus fracture. Also cranial trauma with intraventricular
     hemorrhage, multi-level cervical spine fractures, and rib fractures and
     bilateral chest tubes.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5486**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5487**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 455**] [**Name (STitle) 456**] d'Othee. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 456**]
     [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, was present for and supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE & FINDINGS: The patient was placed in a supine position on the
     fluoroscopy table. The right groin was shaved, prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner. A right femoral venous Cordis catheter was in place prior to
     arrival at the angiography suite. Fluoroscopic guidance was used to identify
     the region of the common femoral artery overlying the lower edge of the
     femoral head. A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 4184**] was made with an 11 blade. A 19 gauge single
     wall puncture needle was introduced into the right common femoral artery. An
     0.035 inch Bentson guidewire was introduced and advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance to the level of the lower abdominal aorta. The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French sheath. The sidearm of the sheath was continuously flushed with
     heparinized saline throughout the entirety of the case. Over the Bentson
     guidewire a 5 French OmniFlush catheter was inserted and positioned at the
     level of the third lumbar vertebra. An AP pelvic arteriogram was performed and
     revealed evidence of contrast extravasation from an arterial branch overlying
     the left femoral head.
     An 0.035 inch angled glidewire was inserted and guided across the aortic
     bifurcation into the left internal iliac artery. The OmniFlush catheter was
     advanced into the left internal iliac artery and a selective left hypogastric
     artery arteriogram was performed. No extravasation was noted.
     Using the angled glidewire the Omni Flush catheter was redirected into the
     left external iliac artery and a selective left external iliac arteriogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed revealing rapid, free extravasation of contrast from a small medial
     arterial branch arising from the junction of the left external iliac and
     common femoral arteries. This branch was believed to be a branch of the
     left inferior epigastric artery, as its medial take-off was at the same
     craniocaudal level as the origin of the left superficial circumflex iliac
     artery (laterally).
     The Omni Flush catheter was exchanged for a 5 French C2 catheter, the tip of
     which was positioned in front of this small arterial branch. Given the small
     size of this branch, a Tracker microcatheter and wire were inserted coaxially
     through the C2 catheter and an 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the small
     arterial branch. After a short medial segment, this branch bifurcated into a
     long vertical branch flowing cranially and a short infero-medial branch. The
     former was believed to be the left inferior epigastric artery, the latter was
     the branch where the bleeding originated.
     The Tracker microcatheter was advanced selectively over the 0.018 wire into
     the bleeding branch under fluoroscopic guidance. Hand injection of contrast
     through the microcatheter was performed under fluoroscopy and confirmed
     correct position of the catheter tip. Two 0.018 x 2 mm diameter x 2 cm long
     coils were deployed successively.
     A superselective contrast injection through the microcatheter was repeated and
     the corresponding arteriogram revealed no evidence of contrast extravasation
     after coil deployment, with stagnant flow in the embolized branch and reflux
     into the left external iliac artery.
     The Tracker catheter was removed and a follow-up arteriogram of the left
     external iliac artery was performed through the Cobra C2 catheter. The
     previously bleeding arterial branch is identified approximately 1 cm in length
     after which point no contrast filling of this branch and no free extravasation
     of contrast is noted.
     The C2 catheter was removed. The right 5 French femoral arterial sheath was
     left in place and sutured with 0 Prolene to the skin, in agreement with the
     Trauma Team.
     The patient had episodes of hypotension throughout the case. He was intubated
     prior to arrival and maintained on a ventilator throughout the case.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received a total of 90 cc of non ionic
     contrast (Optiray 320) throughout the case. He also received a total of 225
     micrograms of Fentanyl IV and 1 mg of Versed IV under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful microcoil embolization of a bleeding arterial branch,
     likely a branch of the inferior epigastric artery. No complications were
     noted.
     The patient was transported by the trauma team to the trauma intensive care
     unit after the procedure with the sheath in place.
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON: There is no prior for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis following
     rapid bolus administration of 150 cc of IV optiray  were performed. Nonionic
     IV contrast was used to rapid bolus administration.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: The intrathoracic aorta is intact with no evidence of
     dissection or laceration. There is a mediastinal hematoma extending to both
     sides of the aortic arch, located anteriorly and adjacent/likely related to a
     comminuted fracture of the superior portion of the sternum. An ET tube and
     bilateral chest tube are seen.  There is left sided subcutaneous emphysema at
     the level of as well as superior and inferior to the left chest tube insertion
     site. There are fractures of the lateral left 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th ribs
     with associated small hemothorax.  Pneumomediastinum is identified. A small
     left anterior pneumothorax is seen. There is no pericardial fluid. There is
     bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Perihepatic and perisplenic free fluid is
     identified. The liver and spleen, however, demonstrate no evidence of
     traumatic injury.  An NG tube is seen at the gastroesophageal junction. The
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. A left simple renal cyst is
     identified. The abdominal aorta and its major branches appear intact. The
     stomach, small bowel and large bowel are unremarkable.  No lymph node
     enlargement.  There is evidence of free air.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Intrapelvic bowel loops appear normal. There is a
     large pelvic hematoma in the anterior midline as well in great majority on the
     left, with evidence of dense, active extravasation of contrast presumably
     related to arterial injury, although the common iliac and bifurcating arterial
     vessels appear intact. Definition of the left common iliac venous vascular
     structures is completely lost at the level of the common iliac bifurcation,
     and are likely torn.  Air is seen within the lower IVC and extending into the
     right common and right external iliac vein and to several smaller branches. A
     comminuted fracture of the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] is identified, but both SI joints
     are intact with no evidence of diastasis. Also identified on the left are
     superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, also comminuted.  The acetabulum
                                                                 (Over)

     and hip joints are intact.  A large amount of free fluid is seen in the left
     paracolic gutter, likely extending from the more inferior left sided pelvic
     hematoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Multiple left sided lateral rib fractures of 2 through 6, with associated
     small hemothorax.
     2. Comminuted fracture of the upper sternum with associated anterior
     mediastinal hematoma.  No evidence of aortic injury.
     3. Tiny small anterior left sided pneumothorax adjacent to the heart.
     Pneumomediastinum identified.
     4. Minimal perisplenic and perihepatic free fluid, with no evidence of
     respective associated solid organ injury of the spleen or liver.
     5. Large left pelvic hematoma with active extravasation, likely related to
     comminuted fracture of the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**]. Also, superior and inferior pubic
     rami fractures on the left.
     6. Free air identified.  This may be related to diagnostic peritoneal lavage.
     7. Air seen within the lower IVC and extending into the right common iliac and
     right external iliac vein and smaller distal branches thereafter.
     8. Apparent tear of the left common iliac vein of the bifurcation.  Major
     abdominal arterial vasculature appears intact, although dense active
     extravasation suggests areterial injury.
     
     These findings were communicated immediately at the time of interpretation to
     the trauma team taking care of the patient.

     bilateral chest tube are seen.  There is left sided subcutaneous emphysema at
     the level of as well as superior and inferior to the left chest tube insertion
     site. There are fractures of the lateral left 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th ribs
     with associated small hemothorax.  Pneumomediastinum is identified. A small
     left anterior pneumothorax is seen. There is no pericardial fluid. There is
     bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Perihepatic and perisplenic free fluid is
     identified. The liver and spleen, however, demonstrate no evidence of
     traumatic injury.  An NG tube is seen at the gastroesophageal junction. The
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. A left simple renal cyst is
     identified. The abdominal aorta and its major branches appear intact. The
     stomach, small bowel and large bowel are unremarkable.  No lymph node
     enlargement.  There is evidence of free air.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Intrapelvic bowel loops appear normal. There is a
     large pelvic hematoma in the anterior midline as well in great majority on the
     left, with evidence of dense, active extravasation of contrast presumably
     related to arterial injury, although the common iliac and bifurcating arterial
     vessels appear intact. Definition of the left common iliac venous vascular
     structures is completely lost at the level of the common iliac bifurcation,

     INDICATION:  S/P MVC with multiple fractures.
     
     Multiple views (7 films) of the right lower extremity were obtained without
     priors for comparison.
     
     There is marked expansion and irregularity of the proximal right femur,
     consistent with an old healed fracture.  No acute fracture of the proximal
     femur is identified and what is seen of the right hip joint space is within
     normal limits.  A catheter overlies the right groin consistent with a central
     line.
     
     There are two non-standard views of the right knee which demonstrate medial
     joint space narrowing and small osteophytes, consistent with degenerative
     disease.  No definite fracture or effusion is seen, though these views are
     quite limited.
     
     AP and lateral views of the right ankle demonstrate apparent asymmetry in the
     ankle mortise which appears wider laterally than medially.  There is also some
     apparent irregularity in the distal fibula.  However, these two views are also
     non-standard in positioning and thus, the veracity of these findings is
     uncertain.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Old healed fracture of the proximal right femur.
     
     2)  Non-standard views of the right knee and ankle suggest there may be an
     abnormality of the right ankle mortise.  However, standard views of both the
     knee and ankle are recommended for more complete evaluation.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Motor vehicle accident with multiple cervical
     fractures rule out carotid vertebral artery dissection. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of intimal irregularity or intimal
     dissection.
     
     ANESTHESIA: Intubated with Nursing sedation. 
     
     INDICATION: This is a 71-year-old man who suffered a motor vehicle accident
     and multiple cervical fractures along with intracranial contusions and
     traumatic subarachnoid blood. He is undergoing cerebral angiogram to rule out
     carotid vertebral artery dissection given the mechanism of injury. 
     
     CONSENT: The patient's son was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to
     the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the possible
     complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, neurological
     deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen complications
     including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The patient's son
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle
     was then used to puncture the right femoral artery, and upon the return of
     brisk arterial blood, a 4 Fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right external
     carotid artery, right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, left
     subclavian artery, left verteral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     external carotid artery, left internal carotid artery.
     
     RESULTS: Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the presence of
     a tonsillar loop at the C2 level with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or
     intimal dissection. Injection of the right common carotid artery at the
     cervical bifurcation reveals no evidence of significant atherosclerosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     evidence of abnormality. Injection of the right subclavian artery reveals a
     smooth margin of the right vertebral artery which is medially pointing with no
     evidence of atherosclerosis or stenosis at the origin. Injection of the right
     vertebral artery shows its course to be normal in the cervical bifurcation
     with slight irregularity which is not significant at the level of the C2-C3
     junction. The posterior circulation including the basilar artery and all its
     branches are within normal limits. Injection of the right external carotid
     artery shows no evidence of abnormal arteriovenous shunting. Injection of the
     left subclavian artery reveals it to be within normal limits with a normal
     left vertebral artery origin. Evaluation of the left vertebral artery shows a
     small degree of intimal irregularity and surrounding blush at the level of C3
     and a small wedge of intimal webbing which is not hemodynamically significant
     and may be due to extrinsic fracture. There is no evidence of dissection
     however. The intracranial course of the left vertebral artery and the
     vertebrobasilar junction from the level of the artery injection is within
     normal limits. Injection of the left common carotid artery reveals it to have
     normal anatomy in the cervical region with a small web at the level of the
     carotid bulb which is not hemodynamically significant and is not ulcerated.
     Injection of the left internal carotid artery is within normal limits and
     shows a small infundibulum at the origin of the lenticulostriate artery. The
     left external carotid artery injection is normal.

     fractures rule out carotid vertebral artery dissection. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of intimal irregularity or intimal
     dissection.
     
     ANESTHESIA: Intubated with Nursing sedation. 
     
     INDICATION: This is a 71-year-old man who suffered a motor vehicle accident
     and multiple cervical fractures along with intracranial contusions and
     traumatic subarachnoid blood. He is undergoing cerebral angiogram to rule out
     carotid vertebral artery dissection given the mechanism of injury. 
     
     CONSENT: The patient's son was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to
     the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the possible
     complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, neurological
     deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen complications
     including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The patient's son
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle
     was then used to puncture the right femoral artery, and upon the return of
     brisk arterial blood, a 4 Fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:

     Injection of the right internal carotid artery intracranially reveals no
     evidence of abnormality. Injection of the right subclavian artery reveals a
     smooth margin of the right vertebral artery which is medially pointing with no
     evidence of atherosclerosis or stenosis at the origin. Injection of the right
     vertebral artery shows its course to be normal in the cervical bifurcation
     with slight irregularity which is not significant at the level of the C2-C3
     junction. The posterior circulation including the basilar artery and all its
     branches are within normal limits. Injection of the right external carotid
     artery shows no evidence of abnormal arteriovenous shunting. Injection of the
     left subclavian artery reveals it to be within normal limits with a normal
     left vertebral artery origin. Evaluation of the left vertebral artery shows a
     small degree of intimal irregularity and surrounding blush at the level of C3
     and a small wedge of intimal webbing which is not hemodynamically significant
     and may be due to extrinsic fracture. There is no evidence of dissection
     however. The intracranial course of the left vertebral artery and the
     vertebrobasilar junction from the level of the artery injection is within
     normal limits. Injection of the left common carotid artery reveals it to have
     normal anatomy in the cervical region with a small web at the level of the
     carotid bulb which is not hemodynamically significant and is not ulcerated.
     Injection of the left internal carotid artery is within normal limits and
     shows a small infundibulum at the origin of the lenticulostriate artery. The
     left external carotid artery injection is normal.
     
     IMPRESSION: Small focal area of intimal irregularity at the left vertebral
     artery at the level of C3 which is not hemodynamically significant and cannot
     be counted as a frank dissection. This is not associated with any intimal
     compromise or stenosis.

     carotid vertebral artery dissection given the mechanism of injury. 
     
     CONSENT: The patient's son was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to
     the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the possible
     complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, neurological
     deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen complications
     including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The patient's son
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.

     traumatic subarachnoid blood. He is undergoing cerebral angiogram to rule out
     carotid vertebral artery dissection given the mechanism of injury. 
     
     CONSENT: The patient's son was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to
     the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the possible
     complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, neurological
     deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen complications
     including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The patient's son
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle
     was then used to puncture the right femoral artery, and upon the return of
     brisk arterial blood, a 4 Fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right external
     carotid artery, right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, left
     subclavian artery, left verteral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     external carotid artery, left internal carotid artery.
     
     RESULTS: Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the presence of
     a tonsillar loop at the C2 level with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or
     intimal dissection. Injection of the right common carotid artery at the
     cervical bifurcation reveals no evidence of significant atherosclerosis.

     Injection of the right internal carotid artery intracranially reveals no
     evidence of abnormality. Injection of the right subclavian artery reveals a
     smooth margin of the right vertebral artery which is medially pointing with no
     evidence of atherosclerosis or stenosis at the origin. Injection of the right
     vertebral artery shows its course to be normal in the cervical bifurcation
     with slight irregularity which is not significant at the level of the C2-C3
     junction. The posterior circulation including the basilar artery and all its
     branches are within normal limits. Injection of the right external carotid
     artery shows no evidence of abnormal arteriovenous shunting. Injection of the
     left subclavian artery reveals it to be within normal limits with a normal
     left vertebral artery origin. Evaluation of the left vertebral artery shows a
     small degree of intimal irregularity and surrounding blush at the level of C3
     and a small wedge of intimal webbing which is not hemodynamically significant
     and may be due to extrinsic fracture. There is no evidence of dissection
     however. The intracranial course of the left vertebral artery and the
     vertebrobasilar junction from the level of the artery injection is within
     normal limits. Injection of the left common carotid artery reveals it to have
     normal anatomy in the cervical region with a small web at the level of the
     carotid bulb which is not hemodynamically significant and is not ulcerated.
     Injection of the left internal carotid artery is within normal limits and
     shows a small infundibulum at the origin of the lenticulostriate artery. The
     left external carotid artery injection is normal.
     
     IMPRESSION: Small focal area of intimal irregularity at the left vertebral
     artery at the level of C3 which is not hemodynamically significant and cannot
     be counted as a frank dissection. This is not associated with any intimal
     compromise or stenosis.

     INDICATION:  S/P MVC with multiple fractures.
     
     Multiple views (7 films) of the right lower extremity were obtained without
     priors for comparison.
     
     There is marked expansion and irregularity of the proximal right femur,
     consistent with an old healed fracture.  No acute fracture of the proximal
     femur is identified and what is seen of the right hip joint space is within
     normal limits.  A catheter overlies the right groin consistent with a central
     line.
     
     There are two non-standard views of the right knee which demonstrate medial
     joint space narrowing and small osteophytes, consistent with degenerative
     disease.  No definite fracture or effusion is seen, though these views are
     quite limited.
     
     AP and lateral views of the right ankle demonstrate apparent asymmetry in the
     ankle mortise which appears wider laterally than medially.  There is also some
     apparent irregularity in the distal fibula.  However, these two views are also
     non-standard in positioning and thus, the veracity of these findings is
     uncertain.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Old healed fracture of the proximal right femur.
     
     2)  Non-standard views of the right knee and ankle suggest there may be an
     abnormality of the right ankle mortise.  However, standard views of both the
     knee and ankle are recommended for more complete evaluation.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Motor vehicle accident with multiple cervical
     fractures rule out carotid vertebral artery dissection. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of intimal irregularity or intimal
     dissection.
     
     ANESTHESIA: Intubated with Nursing sedation. 
     
     INDICATION: This is a 71-year-old man who suffered a motor vehicle accident
     and multiple cervical fractures along with intracranial contusions and
     traumatic subarachnoid blood. He is undergoing cerebral angiogram to rule out
     carotid vertebral artery dissection given the mechanism of injury. 
     
     CONSENT: The patient's son was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to
     the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the possible
     complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, neurological
     deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen complications
     including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The patient's son
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle
     was then used to puncture the right femoral artery, and upon the return of
     brisk arterial blood, a 4 Fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and
     kept on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right external
     carotid artery, right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, left
     subclavian artery, left verteral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     external carotid artery, left internal carotid artery.
     
     RESULTS: Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the presence of
     a tonsillar loop at the C2 level with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or
     intimal dissection. Injection of the right common carotid artery at the
     cervical bifurcation reveals no evidence of significant atherosclerosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     Injection of the right internal carotid artery intracranially reveals no
     evidence of abnormality. Injection of the right subclavian artery reveals a
     smooth margin of the right vertebral artery which is medially pointing with no
     evidence of atherosclerosis or stenosis at the origin. Injection of the right
     vertebral artery shows its course to be normal in the cervical bifurcation
     with slight irregularity which is not significant at the level of the C2-C3
     junction. The posterior circulation including the basilar artery and all its
     branches are within normal limits. Injection of the right external carotid
     artery shows no evidence of abnormal arteriovenous shunting. Injection of the
     left subclavian artery reveals it to be within normal limits with a normal
     left vertebral artery origin. Evaluation of the left vertebral artery shows a
     small degree of intimal irregularity and surrounding blush at the level of C3
     and a small wedge of intimal webbing which is not hemodynamically significant
     and may be due to extrinsic fracture. There is no evidence of dissection
     however. The intracranial course of the left vertebral artery and the
     vertebrobasilar junction from the level of the artery injection is within
     normal limits. Injection of the left common carotid artery reveals it to have
     normal anatomy in the cervical region with a small web at the level of the
     carotid bulb which is not hemodynamically significant and is not ulcerated.
     Injection of the left internal carotid artery is within normal limits and
     shows a small infundibulum at the origin of the lenticulostriate artery. The
     left external carotid artery injection is normal.
     
     IMPRESSION: Small focal area of intimal irregularity at the left vertebral
     artery at the level of C3 which is not hemodynamically significant and cannot
     be counted as a frank dissection. This is not associated with any intimal
     compromise or stenosis.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     (Cont)
     Injection of the right internal carotid artery intracranially reveals no
     evidence of abnormality. Injection of the right subclavian artery reveals a
     smooth margin of the right vertebral artery which is medially pointing with no
     evidence of atherosclerosis or stenosis at the origin. Injection of the right
     vertebral artery shows its course to be normal in the cervical bifurcation
     with slight irregularity which is not significant at the level of the C2-C3
     junction. The posterior circulation including the basilar artery and all its
     branches are within normal limits. Injection of the right external carotid
     artery shows no evidence of abnormal arteriovenous shunting. Injection of the
     left subclavian artery reveals it to be within normal limits with a normal
     left vertebral artery origin. Evaluation of the left vertebral artery shows a
     small degree of intimal irregularity and surrounding blush at the level of C3
     and a small wedge of intimal webbing which is not hemodynamically significant
     and may be due to extrinsic fracture. There is no evidence of dissection
     however. The intracranial course of the left vertebral artery and the
     vertebrobasilar junction from the level of the artery injection is within
     normal limits. Injection of the left common carotid artery reveals it to have
     normal anatomy in the cervical region with a small web at the level of the
     carotid bulb which is not hemodynamically significant and is not ulcerated.
     Injection of the left internal carotid artery is within normal limits and
     shows a small infundibulum at the origin of the lenticulostriate artery. The
     left external carotid artery injection is normal.
     
     IMPRESSION: Small focal area of intimal irregularity at the left vertebral
     artery at the level of C3 which is not hemodynamically significant and cannot
     be counted as a frank dissection. This is not associated with any intimal
     compromise or stenosis.

     COMPARISON: [**3427-3-31**] at 2026.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS: There is a new right frontal drainage catheter in place.  The
     previously described areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage are unchanged in the
     interval.  There is less blood layering dependently within the lateral
     ventricles than on the previous exam, likely sequela of drainage.  There is
     increased soft tissue density within the foramen magnum surrounding the spinal
     cord, likely representing herniation.  The sulci are less prominent than on
     the previous exam, consistent with brain edema.  [**Doctor Last Name **] and white matter
     differentiation may also be less distinct than on the previous exam.  There is
     no hydrocephalus.  There are new air-fluid levels within both maxillary
     sinuses as well as within both sphenoid sinuses.  The ethmoid sinuses are once
     again opacified.  There is increased fluid within the left frontal sinus which
     is layering dependently.  Nasal fractures are again noted.  Pneumocephalus is
     not appreciated.  Staples are noted in the scalp along the posterior midline.
     
     IMPRESSION: Slightly increased brain edema.  Stable appearance of bilateral
     subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Probable persistent herniation into the foramen
     magnum.

     INDICATION:  Pulmonary artery catheter placement.
     
     Comparison:  None available.
     
     FINDINGS:  A right Swan-Ganz catheter is identified with the tip in the right
     inferior pulmonary artery. There is no pneumothorax. The left chest tube is
     seen with the tip in the apex of the left lung. Endotracheal tube is seen with
     the tip 6.3 cm above the carina. There is a nasogastric tube with the tip
     ending at the diaphragmatic junction. It should be advanced. There is a right
     chest tube seen with the tip in the mid-right lung field and the sideport
     overlies the lateral ribs. That may be outside the pleural cavity.
     
     Right upper lobe shows dense opacity with air bronchograms. Given the history,
     pulmonary contusion is likely. Less density but some opacification is seen in
     the left mid-lung field. The cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged, but
     there is a shallow level of inspiration which could make that assessment
     inaccurate. The lateral costophrenic sulci are sharply delineated. Note is
     made of numeros left lateral rib fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Pulmonary contusions bilaterally.
     
     No pneumothorax with tubes as identified above and right Swan-Ganz catheter
     nicely positioned.
     
     Numerous left lateral rib fractures.

     INDICATION: Massive head trauma and multiple injuries ?infarcts.
     
     Multiplanar T1, T2, gradient echo and FLAIR sequences, axial diffusion
     weighted sequences.
     
     Exam was compared with the patient's CT scan of [**3427-4-1**].
     
     FINDINGS: There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest the presence
     of infarction. There are foci of increased susceptibility on the gradient echo
     sequence in the anterior right temporal pole and high right medial parietal
     convexity and in the subarachnoid space consistent with parenchymal and
     subarachnoid blood. There is some material also layering in the lateral
     ventricles. There are small extra-axial fluid collections which do not appear
     to be acute hemorrhage around the frontal lobes. Ventricular drainage catheter
     is present and appears to be patent. Ventricular dimension is within normal
     limits. There does appear to be increased volume of the brain with
     transforminal herniation. There is an air fluid level in the sphenoid sinus.
     There is massive soft tissue swelling of the scalp. There are susceptibility
     defects in the soft tissues of the scalp perhaps related to metallic foreign
     bodies, suture material or monitoring devices.
     
     IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest the
     presence of acute infarction. Transforaminal herniation. Small parenchymal
     hematomas as described.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  MVA, evaluate for hemothorax or pneumothorax. 
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  An endotracheal tube is present, terminating approximately
     7 cm above the carina.  The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the distal
     intralobar portion of the right pulmonary artery.  Bilateral chest tubes are
     present.  The side port of the right chest tube remains in close proximetry to
     the lateral chest wall. Side port of the left chest tube cannot be assessed as
     it is excluded from the radiograph.
     
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. There is some
     prominence of the aortic arch contour.  The pulmonary vascultarity is
     increased and there is improving bilateral perihilar opacity with residual
     haziness as well as an underlying interstitial pattern.  A band like artifact
     is seen in the right lower chest, possibly related to the trauma board.
     
     Note is also made of a nasogastric tube. The side port is not well
     demonstrated but is likely above the GE junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are both relatively proximal in
     location and advancement may be helpful for more optimal placement.
     
     2.  Improving perihilar edema.
     
     3.  Prominence of aortic arch. By report, CT angio showed no evidence of
     aortic injury.
     
     4.  Please note that part of the left lung laterally has been excluded from
     the study and cannot be assessed. Exclusion of lateral left chest prevents
     assessment of known left sided rib fractures.

SOCIAL WORK NOTE:

New trauma pt on T-SICU.  Pt is a 71 year old married man who is s/p high-speed MVC with head bleed.  Pt's car was reportedly broadsided during accident.  This SW met with pt's wife of 45 years, and their son, [**Doctor Last Name 922**], and dtr, [**Doctor First Name **].  They do not have other children.  Family wants son, [**Doctor Last Name 922**], who is a policeman in [**Hospital1 2037**], to be the spokesperson for family (ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4957**]).  Pt's wife has her own health concerns (and is disabled) and family would like son to receive information first so that she can receive support that she needs as needed during this difficult time.  Family plans to contact her PCP to alert him of current situation in case stress of situation exacerbates her own health concerns.  Family aware that ED here available if there were to be any health crises for her while visiting.

Pt and his wife live in [**Location (un) 4958**].  They have 5 grandchildren who range in age from 15 to 7.  Pt is retired from his work at Capital Food and now does some traffic supervisions (for school children at school time).  Pt has a hx of prostate CA (for which his radiation tx finished one year ago) and a hx of hyperlipidemia (for which family reports that he takes Lipitor).  Pt does not have psychiatric or substance abuse hx per family.

Family was appropriately tearful and expressed that pt is ""strong... active... a fighter..."" and they are hopeful that he will be able to pull through this crisis.  They seem mutually supportive of one another and pt's wife expressed particular appreciation for her [**Hospital1 842**] involvement and support.  Family is appreciative of staff communication with them and they report feeling well-informed.  Family said that they have many friends praying for pt and that they hope this will help.  They are [**Doctor First Name 4959**] and seem open to involvement of pastoral care but were not definitive about this.  This SW will inquire about this again tomorrow when I see them again.

       71 year old man with Multiple cervical fractures                               
       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Multiple C spine fractures, Eval for cord injury. Paucity of movement of all 
      extremities.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  Multiple C-spine fractures.  Evaluate for cord injury.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT C-spine dated [**3427-3-31**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, STIR images were performed through the
     cervical spine.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a linear area of T2 signal hyperintensity at the superior
     portion of the T2 vertebral body, raising suspicion for a fracture.  There is
     high signal in the region of the interspinous ligaments extending from the C4
     to the C6 level. The other spinal fractures, which were described on the CT
     scan, are not apparent on the MR study, as expected.  There is edema within
     the paraspinal soft tissues. There is no evidence of cord compression or edema
     within the spinal cord. There is no evidence of cervical vertebral
     subluxation.  The intervertebral discs are somewhat decreased in height,
     consistent with minor degenerative changes. There is no evidence of cervical
     spinal disc herniation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. There is no evidence of cord compression or edema within the spinal cord.
     There is a probable small compression fracture of the T2 vertebral body
     without significant loss of vertebral body height.  There is no evidence of
     posterior protrusion into the spinal canal.  Please see the CT C-spine report
     for detailed evaluation of the cervical spine fractures.
     
     2. There is probable disruption of the interspinous ligaments extending from
     the C4 to the C6 levels.  There is a large amount of edema within the adjacent
     paraspinal soft tissues.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, FLAIR, and susceptibility images were
     performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been no significant change in the appearance of the brain
     compared with three days prior.  There are multiple areas of susceptibility,
     as previously described.  These are noted within the anterior right temporal
     lobe, the superior right medial parietal lobe and within proximity of the
     aqueduct of Sylvius. There is evidence of hemorrhage within the subarachnoid
     space and lateral ventricles. A ventricular drainage catheter is present.
     There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.  There is no evidence of transtentorial
     or tonsillar herniation.

     A right subclavian central venous catheter is in satisfactory position within
     the superior vena cava.  No pneumothorax is evident. The feeding tube is in
     place, with the tip terminating in the proximal stomach. The proximal aspect
     of the radiodense tip is above the GE junction. A nasogastric tube terminates
     in the gastroduodenal junction regions. Bilateral chest tubes remain in place.
     An endotracheal tube is also present, with the tip in a relatively distal
     location, terminating within 2 cm of the carina. The cuff also appears over
     distended.  Persistent patchy pulmonary opacities are unchanged.  A previously
     identified left sided pneumothorax is not well visualized on this study.

     tubes remain in stable position.  There is a moderate-sized left apical,
     lateral and medial pneumothorax.  There are multiple associated left rib
     fractures, and their appearance is concerning for possible flail chest.  The
     cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There are persistent bilateral
     pulmonary opacities, likely secondary to contusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Moderate-sized left-sided pneumothorax.
     
     2. Extensive serial rib fractures, an appearance worrisome for possible flail
     chest.
     
     3. Stable appearance of bilateral pulmonary contusions.

Respiratory Care:
ABG's remain well oxygenated with a slight respiratory alkalosis, on 15cmH20 PS and 5cmH20 peep.  Pt. continues to have frequent periods of gasping type inspirations, with a ""hiccup"" pattern.  With this, is increased accesory muscle usage, and Pt. pulling a large negative deflection on inspiration.  Secretions remain problematic>>ranging from copious to moderate, thick red/brown with occasional plugs.  Weaning, at this point may only lead to increased WOB, for Pt. to maintain acid-base state he desires.  Hard collar remains in place.  Copious oral secretions persist as well.

     STUDY:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.
     
     INDICATION:  71 year old male with trauma and recurrent fevers.  Evaluate for
     fluid collection or abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis after the intravenous
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray.  Non-ionic contrast was used due to
     patient debility.  Comparison is made to a prior CT performed on [**3427-3-31**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is evidence of atelectasis at the lung
     bases bilaterally.  The liver is normal in contour and attenuation with no
     evidence of hepatic mass or biliary ductal dilatation.  The pancreas and
     spleen are unremarkable.  There is decreased size of the previously seen peri-
     splenic fluid collection.  The adrenal glands are within normal limits. Both
     kidneys enhance and excrete contrast promptly and symmetrically. There is a
     small simple renal cyst present in the left kidney. No other evidence of renal
     mass, stone, or hydronephrosis.  There is an NG tube in position with its
     distal tip in the antrum of the stomach. The visualized portions of stomach,
     small bowel, and colon show no abnormal dilatation or wall thickening.  There
     is no evidence of pathologic retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement.  There is
     no evidence of free fluid within the abdomen. .
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a large left-sided hematoma
     measuring 11.4 x 7.6 cm in the lower left pelvic region adjacent to the left
     pubis bone fractures. This hematoma appears slightly larger when compared to
     the prior study from [**3427-3-31**].  There are multiple fractures within the left
     pelvis with a large comminuted fracture of the left iliac bone, fractures of
     the superior and inferior pubic rami on the left, as well as several rib
     fractures on the left. There is evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma in the
     iliopsoas region on the left adjacent to the large comminuted left iliac bone
     fracture which appears stable in size. There is no evidence of free air or
     free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis. The urinary bladder is displaced to
     the right by the large hematoma in the left pelvic region.  The urinary
     bladder is nondistended and there is a Foley catheter in position. There is
     evidence of air within the urinary bladder. The rectum is unremarkable.  There
     is no evidence of free fluid within the pelvis.

     STUDY:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.
     
     INDICATION:  71 year old male with trauma and recurrent fevers.  Evaluate for
     fluid collection or abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis after the intravenous
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray.  Non-ionic contrast was used due to
     patient debility.  Comparison is made to a prior CT performed on [**3427-3-31**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is evidence of atelectasis at the lung
     bases bilaterally.  The liver is normal in contour and attenuation with no
     evidence of hepatic mass or biliary ductal dilatation.  The pancreas and
     spleen are unremarkable.  There is decreased size of the previously seen peri-
     splenic fluid collection.  The adrenal glands are within normal limits. Both
     kidneys enhance and excrete contrast promptly and symmetrically. There is a
     small simple renal cyst present in the left kidney. No other evidence of renal
     mass, stone, or hydronephrosis.  There is an NG tube in position with its
     distal tip in the antrum of the stomach. The visualized portions of stomach,
     small bowel, and colon show no abnormal dilatation or wall thickening.  There
     is no evidence of pathologic retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement.  There is
     no evidence of free fluid within the abdomen. .
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a large left-sided hematoma
     measuring 11.4 x 7.6 cm in the lower left pelvic region adjacent to the left
     pubis bone fractures. This hematoma appears slightly larger when compared to
     the prior study from [**3427-3-31**].  There are multiple fractures within the left
     pelvis with a large comminuted fracture of the left iliac bone, fractures of
     the superior and inferior pubic rami on the left, as well as several rib
     fractures on the left. There is evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma in the
     iliopsoas region on the left adjacent to the large comminuted left iliac bone
     fracture which appears stable in size. There is no evidence of free air or
     free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis. The urinary bladder is displaced to
     the right by the large hematoma in the left pelvic region.  The urinary
     bladder is nondistended and there is a Foley catheter in position. There is
     evidence of air within the urinary bladder. The rectum is unremarkable.  There
     is no evidence of free fluid within the pelvis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Large left-sided hematoma within the pelvis adjacent to fractures of the
                                                                 (Over)

     superior and inferior pubic rami on the left.  This hematoma causes
     displacement of the bladder to the right and appears slightly larger when
     compared to the prior from 8 days previous.  No evidence of active
     extravasation. No evidence of free fluid within the pelvis.
     
     2) Large hematoma in the iliopsoas region anterior to the left iliac crest
     adjacent to a comminuted fracture of the left iliac bone.  This hematoma
     appears stable when compared to the prior exam from [**3427-3-31**].

SOCIAL WORK NOTE:

FAMILY MEETING SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY AT 11:30am.  T-SICU and NEUROSURG TEAMS AWARE.

This SW spoke with pt's son, [**Doctor Last Name 922**], and wife, [**Doctor First Name 1443**], by phone today separately to work on arranging family meeting and to clarify who from family would attend.  Staff had expressed some concern that pt's wife would not be attending and wanted to confirm that this was in keeping with her own wishes and not that her children were trying to shield her in a way that was not in keeping with her wishes.  This SW spoke with pt's wife at length and she confirmed that she does not plan to attend the meeting.  She thinks that it is best for her own health if she does not hear too much information at once and prefers that her son, [**Doctor First Name **], and dtr, [**Doctor First Name **], attend and then talk with her afterwards.  She is seeing her own PCP today to [**Name9 (PRE) 3725**] on various health issues she is experiencing at this time and also to talk about her difficulty sleeping.  Pt's children are willing to attend meeting and then talk with their mother afterwards and they agree that this is best for her.  Family expressed understanding of why staff was seeking clarification around this issue.  This SW plans to attend meeting and will remain involved for family support and assistance as needed.

SOCIAL WORK NOTE:

Family meeting held today at 11:30am with pt's son, [**Doctor First Name **], dtr, [**Doctor First Name **], and dtr-in-law, [**Doctor First Name 761**].  As aforementioned, pt's wife had not planned to attend meeting today.  In the interim, pt's wife visited her PCP and has been admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital6 **] due to chest pain.  Pt's family is now in position of trying to be present for both parents.

This SW, RN [**Doctor Last Name **], and Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 345**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2521**], and [**Doctor Last Name 2587**] (T-SICU, Trauma, and Neurosurgery respectively) were present.  Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 495**] family a medical update which indicated that pt's head injury is his main issue and that his neurological status has not improved much since sedation was taken off.  Pt has had minimal movements and minimal response to pain per MDs.  If aggressive care were to continue, pt would likely need trach and PEG.  Pt's family reports that pt is a ""vital"" and ""active"" man who would not want to live on life support and would not want to be dependent and need nursing home level care.  They would like to think this through for a couple more days and would like to be able to talk with their mother about it as able without compromising her health further.  They did consent to pt being DNR.  Plan is for family to talk with team again (either formally or informally as per their preference) in a couple days and to consider directing pt's care towards comfort.

Pt's son called this SW later in day as family is trying to figure out how to facilitate having their mother see their father again and to have eldest grandchildren visit as well.  This SW will remain involved for family support.  Pager [**Pager number 243**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post motor vehicle accident.  Left subclavian line placed.
     Evaluate position and rule out pneumothorax.
     
     FINDINGS:  The left subclavian central line tip is in the left brachiocephalic
     vein near the SVC origin.  The endotracheal tube is well positioned in the
     trachea.  The NG tube is in the proximal portion of the stomach and could be
     advanced somewhat.  The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement.  The
     pulmonary vessels do not indicate cardiac failure.  Some patchy bibasilar
     pulmonary infiltrates are noted more on the left.  These probably represent
     lung contusion secondary to the multiple rib fractures on the left side
     between T3 and T7 laterally.  There appears to be some collapse/consolidation
     in the basilar segment of the left lower lobe behind the heart.  A right
     subclavian central line is also noted with its tip well positioned in the mid
     SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral subclavian lines, the endotracheal tube, and the NG
     tube positions are noted.  Patchy infiltrates in the left lung are probably
     due to contusions associated with the multiple rib fractures.  Associated
     pleural widening along the left lateral chest border.

     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Question empyema in patient status post trauma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung apices to the
     pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of optiray contrast.
     Optiray was used per patient delibility.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3427-4-8**].
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart, paracardium, and great vessels are
     normal.  There are multiple small non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in
     the aorticopulmonary window, and precarinal regions of the mediastinum.  There
     is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The airways are patent to the
     segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are bibasilar consolidations
     posteriorly, slightly increased on the left since the prior study.  There is
     also patchy pulmonary opacification adjacent to a right upper rib fracture
     consistent with contusion.  There are small bilateral dependently layering
     pleural effusions which do not show evidence of loculation and there are no
     enhancing margins.  There is a small collection measuring 2.6 x 2.3 cm
     posterior to the sternomanubrial junction with [**Doctor Last Name **] of 45.  There are osseous
     fragments in this region and this likely represents contained hemorrhage.
     There are fractures of the left second through seventh ribs and the right
     second rib with associated hemorrhage within the soft tissues.  There is no
     evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal
     glands, kidneys, ureters, and loops of small and large bowel are normal. There
     is no free intraperitoneal fluid or air.  There is no lymphadenopathy and
     there are no fluid collections.  A linear midline skin defect is consistent
     with surgical incision.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are fractures of the superior and
     inferior pubic ramus as well as the left iliac bone (comminuted).  There is an
     associated large hematoma along the left pelvic side wall measuring
     approximately 8.5 x 10.8 cm.  This is little changed from the prior study. The
     bladder and sigmoid colon are displaced rightward by this large left pelvic
     hematoma.  There is evidence of this bleed tracking superiorly along the
     posterior renal fascia.  There is no free pelvic peritoneal fluid or
     lymphadenopathy.  A Foley catheter decompresses the bladder.

     INDICATION:  Evaluate for hydrocephalus in a patient with subarachnoid and
     intraventricular hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3427-4-1**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is decreased subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly subjacent
     to both parietal and occipital lobes.  There is also less intraventricular
     hemorrhage within both occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.  The right
     frontal intraventricular drain remains in position.  Grey/white matter
     differentiation appears normal.  There is no hydrocephalus.  There is less
     soft tissue density within the foramen magnum surrounding the spinal cord,
     suggesting lessened herniation of the cerebellar tonsils.
     
     Again noted are multiple nasal fractures and high attenuation fluid within
     both maxillary sinuses, ethmoid air cells, mastoid air cells, sphenoid sinus
     and frontal sinus.  Metallic skin staples overlie the occiput.
     
     IMPRESSION: Slight improvement of the subarachnoid hemorrhage and
     intraventricular hemorrhage with reduced tonsillar herniation into the foramen
     magnum.

     CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST; CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST
     Reason: EMPYEMA/INTRA ABD ABSCESS POST TRAUMA
     Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 150
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        63 year old man with multitrauma                                              
       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate for empyema                                                            
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Question empyema in patient status post trauma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung apices to the
     pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of optiray contrast.
     Optiray was used per patient delibility.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3427-4-8**].
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart, paracardium, and great vessels are
     normal.  There are multiple small non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in
     the aorticopulmonary window, and precarinal regions of the mediastinum.  There
     is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The airways are patent to the
     segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are bibasilar consolidations
     posteriorly, slightly increased on the left since the prior study.  There is
     also patchy pulmonary opacification adjacent to a right upper rib fracture
     consistent with contusion.  There are small bilateral dependently layering
     pleural effusions which do not show evidence of loculation and there are no
     enhancing margins.  There is a small collection measuring 2.6 x 2.3 cm
     posterior to the sternomanubrial junction with [**Doctor Last Name **] of 45.  There are osseous
     fragments in this region and this likely represents contained hemorrhage.
     There are fractures of the left second through seventh ribs and the right
     second rib with associated hemorrhage within the soft tissues.  There is no
     evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal
     glands, kidneys, ureters, and loops of small and large bowel are normal. There
     is no free intraperitoneal fluid or air.  There is no lymphadenopathy and
     there are no fluid collections.  A linear midline skin defect is consistent
     with surgical incision.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are fractures of the superior and
     inferior pubic ramus as well as the left iliac bone (comminuted).  There is an
     associated large hematoma along the left pelvic side wall measuring
     approximately 8.5 x 10.8 cm.  This is little changed from the prior study. The
     bladder and sigmoid colon are displaced rightward by this large left pelvic
     hematoma.  There is evidence of this bleed tracking superiorly along the
     posterior renal fascia.  There is no free pelvic peritoneal fluid or
     lymphadenopathy.  A Foley catheter decompresses the bladder.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Small bilateral pleural effusions with no evidence of empyema.
     2)  Bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, which could represent
     contusion vs. aspiration vs. infection.  There is also evidence of contusion
     associated with the right second rib fracture.
     3)  Multiple rib fractures and pelvic fractures as described.
     4)  Large hematoma in the left deep pelvis, little changed.
