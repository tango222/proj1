     INDICATION:  Right lower quadrant pain, rule out bowel obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis with oral and intravenous contrast.
     Coronal reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 150 cc of intravenous Optiray were administered
     secondary to the patient's history of asthma.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3438-2-27**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of intraperitoneal
     free air.  The liver, spleen, adrenals and pancreas are within normal limits.
     There are tiny punctate low attenuation foci in the cortex of the right
     kidney, likely simple renal cysts but too small to characterize.  Within the
     left kidney there are similar findings as well as a larger 2 cm exophytic
     simple cyst.  The stomach and duodenum appear intact.  The small bowel is
     unremarkable.  There is no significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric
     adenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again there is a large amount of
     intraperitoneal air with two more focal collections, one in the region of the
     cecum and extending along the right paracolic gutter and another more focal
     collection along the left lateral sigmoid.  There is no evidence of gas within
     the vasculature and portal venous system.  There are scattered air bubbles
     throughout the mesenteric fat.  The celiac, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) **], portal vein and splenic
     vein appear grossly patent.  There is a small amount of intraperitoneal and
     pelvic fluid.  There is extensive diverticulosis throughout the colon as well
     as a few diverticula in the terminal ileum.  There is some mild fat stranding
     around the cecum as well as adjacent to the sigmoid.  There is no
     extravasation of either intravenous or oral contrast.  The uterus has a
     heterogeneous appearance with some areas of coarse calcification consistent
     with a fibroid uterus.
     
     Bone windows reveal degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.  There is a
     small area of lucency in the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 84**] of doubtful clinical
     significance.  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

     There is atelectasis within the right lower lobe as well as a small right
     pleural effusion which may in part be loculated.  There is a small nodule in
     the lateral right lung base.  This was not present on the prior study and
     follow-up is recommended.  The pleural effusion and atelectasis was present
     previously.  The left lung base reveals no suspicious nodules and no effusion.
     
     Reformatted images support the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Moderate amount of free intraperitoneal air without a definite source. The
     most likely source is a perforated sigmoid diverticulum or perforation
     adjacent to the cecum.  With the extensive diverticulosis this likely is the
     underlying cause; however, the patient does have known lung malignancy and a
     metastatic focus is another consideration although less likely.  Another
     possibility includes a perforated appendicitis however this is more free air
     than typically seen with perforated appendicitis.
     2.  Mild amount of intraperitoneal free fluid without extravasation of oral
     contrast.
     3.  Small nodule in the right lung base laterally not present on the prior
     film.  This may be related to atelectasis or a metastatic focus.  Follow-up is
     indicated.  Stable atelectasis and right effusion.
     
     The ordering Emergency Room physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1123**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 1124**], was notified immediately

Service:  GENERAL S.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old
female status post thoracotomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 231**] one week prior
for small cell lung carcinoma.  The patient was seen by the
doctor today.  The patient had complaints of right lower
quadrant pain times four days with fevers with nausea,
vomiting, and increasing distention.  The patient has had
diverticula on prior CT studies.  No prior colonoscopies.
Prior duodenal ulcer history treated medially.  No prior
abdominal surgeries.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Small cell lung carcinoma.
4.  ASD repair.
5.  Pulmonary hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies..

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Paroxetine.
2.  Sotalol.
3.  Alprazolam.
4.  Albuterol.
5.  Prednisone.
6.  Lasix,
7.  Coumadin.
8.  Protonix.
9.  Home oxygen.

The patient had a CT scan done, which showed no coronary
artery disease and ejection fraction of 60%.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was
afebrile.  Vital signs were stable.  Abdomen was firm and
distended, tender at the right lower quadrant greater than
the left lower quadrant with guarding, rebound, and
percussion tenderness.  There were no hernias noted.

The patient had a white count of 15, hematocrit 36, platelet
count 310,000.  Potassium was 3.6.  Otherwise, electrolytes
were within normal limits.

CT showed positive free air, positive cecal sigmoid
diverticula.  Duodenum appeared intact with intraluminal air
and positive pelvic free fluid.

The patient was placed on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The
patient was made NPO.  The patient was started on IV fluids
and Foley catheter was placed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**4-27**] for a perforated viscus, sigmoid diverticulitis,
and secondary appendicitis.  Hartmann's procedure with
appendectomy was done with no complications.  The patient was
transferred to the SICU, intubated for monitoring.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was extubated.  The
patient was afebrile, vital signs were stable.  The patient
had 100% saturation on two liters nasal cannula.  White count
was done to 10.  Hematocrit was 29.  Platelet count was
305,000.  Other electrolytes were within normal limits.
Overnight, on postoperative day #1, the patient had an
episode of shortness of breath.  The patient was placed on
KVO and given Lasix.  The patient also had a brief run of
atrial fibrillation for which she was given Lopressor.

On postoperative day #3, steroids were to be weaned.  Lasix
was continued.  The patient was still on Lopressor.  White
count now was 11.3.  The patient was placed on broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

On postoperative day #5, the patient was still on Ampicillin,
Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  The patient was afebrile.  Vital
signs were stable with the same bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  The patient had
positive tympany.  Serosanguinous fluid in ostomy bag, viable
appearing pink stoma.  White count had increased to 17.6, now
down to 13.3.

On postoperative day #6, the patient continued to be
afebrile, vital signs were stable.  The patient was still on
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  The patient appeared
to be opening up, started on PO pain medications.

The patient's white count was noted to be 18.3.  Abdominal CT
was performed to rule out any leak or abscess.  CT was
negative.

On postoperative day #7, the INR was found to be
supratherapeutic at 14.5.  Vitamin K was given.  IV:  The
patient continued to be afebrile, vital signs were stable.
White count now decreased to 12.9.  The INR was now down to
1.4.  The patient with gas in ostomy.  The patient continued
to advance with diet, holding the Coumadin.  Antibiotics were
discontinued.

On postoperative day #8, the patient had no complaints.  The
patient was afebrile.  Vital signs were stable.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  White count was now at
12.8.  The patient was felt to be tolerating a good diet and
pain was controlled.  The patient was ambulating freely.  The
patient was stable for discharge to home with VNA services.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
VNA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post Hartmann's procedure.
2.  Appendectomy.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Small cell lung carcinoma.
5.  Pulmonary hypertension.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Percocet for pain control.

     INDICATION: Status post exploratory laparotomy and Hartmann pouch.  Still
     intubated post-op.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3438-4-19**]
     
     SUPINE AP CHEST: Patient is status post unchanged median sternotomy.
     Endotracheal tube has tip 4 cm above the carina.  NG tube has tip in the
     stomach.  Allowing for differences in technique, cardiac, mediastinal and
     hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity cannot be evaluated with
     supine technique.  Right basilar opacities are more prominent than on the
     prior study, from enlarged pleural effusion.  Left perihilar haziness is
     suggestive of interstitial edema or aspiration. No left sided pleural effusion
     is seen. Osseous structures show interval resection of right sixth rib.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Stable cardiomegaly.  Supine technique prevents evaluation of
     the pulmonary vessels. 2) Left perihilar haziness could represent unilateral
     interstitial edema or aspiration. 3) Interval resection of right sixth rib.
     4) Increased right-sided pleural effusion.

     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray. Non-ionic contrast was used, secondary to h/o allergies.  Coronal

     CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  The heart is notable for poly-chamber enlargement.
     There is redemonstration of right lower lobe atelectasis with geograhic
     pattern suggestive of post-radiation change. Again see is right lower lobe
     effusion with split pleural sign, suggesting loculation and possible empyema.
     A small left effusion is also present which is also new since the prior study.
     The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, kidneys and ureters are
     unremarkable and unchanged. A left renal exophytic cyst is again noted. The
     gallbladder fluid is noted to have increased attenuation likely due to
     contrast excretion from prior study. A trace amount of fluid is noted in
     [**Location (un) 1128**] pouch and a moderate amount of fluid is noted in the pelvis with no
     evidence of abscess formation or abnormal air pockets.  The distal small bowel
     and colon is well opacified to the ostomy.  There is no evidence of contrast
     extravasation to suggest leak.  A midline incision site with skin clips is
     noted with no abnormal fluid collections in the subcutaneous tissues. There is
     no retroperitoneal, mesenteric, deep pelvic, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     There is no free air in the abdomen or pelvis.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Calcification in uterus consistent with fibroid.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  ? abscess vs leak in patient s/p sigmoidectomy for
     diverticulitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray. Non-ionic contrast was used, secondary to h/o allergies.  Coronal
     reformations were subsequently obtained and reviewed.
     
     Comparison: [**3438-4-26**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  The heart is notable for poly-chamber enlargement.
     There is redemonstration of right lower lobe atelectasis with geograhic
     pattern suggestive of post-radiation change. Again see is right lower lobe
     effusion with split pleural sign, suggesting loculation and possible empyema.
     A small left effusion is also present which is also new since the prior study.
     The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, kidneys and ureters are
     unremarkable and unchanged. A left renal exophytic cyst is again noted. The
     gallbladder fluid is noted to have increased attenuation likely due to
     contrast excretion from prior study. A trace amount of fluid is noted in
     [**Location (un) 1128**] pouch and a moderate amount of fluid is noted in the pelvis with no
     evidence of abscess formation or abnormal air pockets.  The distal small bowel
     and colon is well opacified to the ostomy.  There is no evidence of contrast
     extravasation to suggest leak.  A midline incision site with skin clips is
     noted with no abnormal fluid collections in the subcutaneous tissues. There is
     no retroperitoneal, mesenteric, deep pelvic, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     There is no free air in the abdomen or pelvis.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Calcification in uterus consistent with fibroid.
     Urinary bladder unremarkable.  No lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are seen.
     Degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of abscess or leak, s/p sigmoid colon resection.
     2)  Moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis tracking up to [**Location (un) 1128**]
     pouch.
     3)  Stable appearance of right lower lobe atelectasis vs post-radiation change
     and apparently loculated small right pleural effusion.  Empyema cannot be
     excluded.

     INDICATION: Status post biopsy, evaluate for pneumothorax.
     
     CHEST, AP: AP view demonstrates status post sternotomy.  Surgical clips are
     identified in the mediastinal structures.  Paracardiac enlargement is present
     with evidence of left ventricular contour to the left.  There is local plate
     atelectasis in the right lung base and a local circular thin walled shadow
     surrounding a most likely emphysematous bleb.  Right apical area on chest
     superimposed by the proximal clavicle and local parenchymal density is seen
     with some linear extensions toward the hilum.  In the right upper lobe area
     there is local pleural density with a possible small double contour but this
     is not representing a significant pneumothorax. Also observed is a resection
     of the 6th rib.  Available for comparison is a previous portable AP chest
     examination dated [**4-28**], findings are practically unchanged.  Thus there is
     no evidence for any new significant pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  Right apical lung lesion, failed open wedge.  For biopsy.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with torso CT dated [**3438-2-27**].
     
     CT LOCALIZATION:  The patient was positioned in the LAO position feet first
     into the scanner with grid placed over the right upper back.  Spiculated right
     apical lung lesion was identified and an appropriate region marked on the
     skin.
     
     CT GUIDANCE:  The skin mark was anesthetized with local lidocaine injection.
     Under the guidance of CT fluoroscopy, a 19-gauge coaxial needle was advanced
     to the margin of the pleura subjacent to the spiculated lesion.  A 20-gauge
     Franseen needle was then advanced through the coaxial needle and multiple
     representative samples were obtained.  Four total passes were made, and at the
     end of the procedure an aspiration was performed through the coaxial needle.
     
     C- POST BIOPSY CHEST CT:  There is no pneumothorax.  A new right lower lobe
     nodule is identified on the post-procedure scan visualized on one slice only
     and measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter.  Its margins are smooth.  There
     are no additional nodules identified.  There are stable radiation changes in
     the medial aspect of the right lung.  There is accompanying volume loss on the
     right.  This is stable.  Epicardial pacing leads are again noted, as are
     sternal wires and multiple mediastinal clips.  There is no left-sided
     effusion.  There is no discernible lymphadenopathy.  The visualized organs of
     the upper abdomen are within normal limits.  The osseous structures of the
     thorax demonstrate no suspicious findings.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY:  Difficulty swallowing with regurgitation of food.
     
     Barium passes without obstruction through the esophagus.  There is no
     aspiration into the airway. There is moderate pooling in the valleculae, which
     fails to clear on subsequent swallows.  There is normal relaxation of the
     cricopharyngeus segment.  No structural abnormality is detected in the region
     of the hypopharynx or upper esophagus.  There are normal primary peristaltic
     contractions.  There is a small axial hiatal hernia.  No GE reflux is observed
     during the study.  A 13-mm barium tablet passes freely through the esophagus
     without holdup at any specific location.  The stomach distends and empties
     normally.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Moderate pooling in the valleculae and pyriform sinuses without
     evidence of aspiration into the airway, of uncertain clinical significance.
     Correlate clinically and if necessary, a video oropharyngogram done in
     conjunction with the swallowing therapist may be helpful for management of the
     swallowing problem.  Small axial hiatal hernia without demonstrable GE reflux.
      Normal passage of barium tablet.

      63 year old woman with h/o small cell lung cancer s/p chemo and xrt in '[**29**] with
      new right apical lung nodule which she has had failed open lung biopsy due to
      extensive scarring and failed FNA. Please asses interval growth.

      f/up right apical lung nodule. Please compare to CT scan performed on [**3438-2-27**].
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Prior history of lung CA in [**3429**], status post chemotherapy and
     radiation therapy.  Right apical lung nodule with nondiagnostic biopsy
     procedure.
     
     Compared to previous CT guided biopsy procedure of [**3438-6-1**], as well as
     previous CT torso dated [**3438-2-27**].
     
     Helical CT of the thorax was performed following IV administration of 100 cc
     Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was administered due to history of allergies.
     Images were initially acquired with 5 mm collimation and reconstructed at 5 mm
     intervals.  Additional targeted thin-section 1.25 mm images were obtained
     through the right apex.
     
     Again demonstrated is the presence of a right apical lung nodule.  The nodule
     has irregular margins and contains an air bronchogram.  The nodule measures
     approximately 16 mm x 13 mm in diameter.  Previously, it measured
     approximately 14 mm x 9 mm in diameter in [**3438-5-21**].  This was present dating
     back to [**3438-2-19**], at which time measurements were recorded as approximately
     13 mm x 12 mm in diameter.
     
     Assessment of the remaining portions of the lungs is remarkable for volume
     loss in the right hemithorax and scattered areas of parenchymal scarring,
     which appear stable.  There is also a focal area of rounded pleural thickening
     in the upper right hemithorax posterolaterally adjacent to a thoracotomy site.
      This is not seen on the [**3438-2-19**] study but was present on the [**3438-5-21**]
     study and does appear significantly changed compared to that time.  There is a
     background pattern of emphysema present.  Radiation changes are noted
     anteromedially in the right lung with associated volume loss and traction
     bronchiectasis.  This appears stable.  A small soft tissue density is seen
     wihtin the bronchus intermedius medially, and was not seen on previous scans.
     This abuts the anteromedial wall and measures about 4 mm in diameter.  No
     obstructing endobronchial lesions are evident.  Radiation changes centrally in
     the right mid and lower lung zones are also stable compared to [**3438-2-19**].
     Small peripheral linear opacity in the left lower lobe may be due to focal
     scarring or focal discoid atelectasis.
     
     Additional areas of dependent density are noted in the airway at the level of
     the proximal right main stem bronchus and along the right lateral wall of the
     trachea, most likely due to dependent secretions, given their dependent
                                                                 (Over)

     location.
     
     Skeletal structures of the thorax reveal evidence of prior right thoracotomy
     procedure.  There has also been previous sternotomy.  Note is made of porosis
     of several ribs on the right side posteriorly just below the level of the
     thoracotomy site.  This is without change since the previous study and
     could potentially reflect radiation change, given proximity to radiation
     changes in the lungs.
     
     Soft tissue structures of the thorax reveal smoothly marginated pleural
     thickening in the upper right hemithorax, which appears stable.  No
     significantly enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are evident.  There
     is marked enlargement of the main and central pulmonary arteries, suggesting
     pulmonary hypertension.  Also noted is enlargement of the right atrium and
     right ventricle.  The pericardium is unremarkable with evidence of effusion.
     Pleural surfaces are remarkable for a stable appearing loculated small right
     pleural effusion with adjacent smoothly marginated pleural thickening.  No
     significant left pleural effusion is seen.
     
     In the upper portion of the abdomen, the adrenal glands are normal, as well as
     the imaged portions of the kidneys.  Assessment of the imaged portions of the
     spleen, pancreas and liver reveals no suspicious lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Right apical lung nodule with poorly defined margins and a prominent air
     bronchogram.  This appears to have slightly grown in the interval compared to
     previous scans of July and [**3438-2-19**] and is concerning for a second primary
     lung cancer (rather than metastatic focus) given the long interval since the
     patient's prior lung CA. Considering nondiagnostic fine needle aspiration
     biopsy, consider re- biopsy or Nuclear Medicine FDG scan for further
     assessment.
     
     2. New small focal lobulated pleural opacity in right upper hemithorax
     posteriorly near the thoracotomy site, unchanged since [**3438-5-21**] but new since
     [**3438-2-19**].  This has fluid attenuation and is likely due to a small area of
     loculated fluid. Other areas of pleural thickening and effusion are unchanged
     compared to April.
     
     3. Marked enlargement of main and central pulmonary arteries, suggesting
     pulmonary hypertension, with associated right ventricular enlargement.
     
     4. Stable post-radiation changes in the right hemithorax.

     again.  Left ventricular enlargement of the heart and mid-line sternal sutures
     also again noted.  These appearance are all unchanged since the prior study.
     There is no evidence of any pneumothorax at this time following the biopsy.

     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3438-10-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous serial axial images were obtained through the cest
     after the administration of 100 cc of non-ionic Optiray contrast using 5-mm
     collimation.  Reconstructions were performed at 5-mm intervals.  Additional
     thin cuts, 2.5-mm collimation, were performed through the upper thorax.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There are numerous small mediastinal and
     axillary lymph nodes that do not meet CT requirement for pathologic
     enlargement.  There are extensive dense vascular calcifications.  The heart is
     upper limits of normal.  There is stable enlargement of the main and central
     pulmonary arteries.  Smoothly marginated pleural thickening is again noted
     within the right upper hemithorax.
     
     Lung windows reveal no significant change in the 1.1 x 1.2 cm spiculated right
     apical nodule.  There is diffuse emphysema.  There is stable radiation change
     within the anteromedial right lung with associated volume loss and traction
     bronchiectasis.  Somewhat focal filling defects are present within the
     dependent and right lateral aspect of the trachea consistent with retained
     secretions.  No obstructing endoluminal defects are identified.
     
     The incompletely visualized liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenals and
     kidneys are grossly unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes.  There is
     stable thickening of multiple right lower-thoracic ribs, unchanged from prior
     study and of uncertain clinical significance.
