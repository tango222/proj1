Admission Date:  [**3363-3-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**3363-4-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**3299-1-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU-[**Hospital1 884**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Confusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old white female
with a history of multiple myeloma, complicated by end-stage
renal disease on hemodialysis, complicated by multiple clots on
Coumadin, who was brought to an outside hospital by her boyfriend
with confusion, nausea and vomiting of black vomitus, and
headache.  Evidently, approximately one month prior to admission
the patient had fallen and hit her head without any neurological
symptoms, loss of consciousness, or sequelae.  Then,
approximately three days prior to admission, the patient was
noted to have increasing confusion by her boyfriend and daughter.
The patient was also noted to have an increase in easy bruising,
anorexia, nausea and vomiting.  Evidently, the patient had been
inadvertently taking Coumadin thinking that it was darvocet,
which she was taking for low back pain.

On review of systems, the patient reported an approximately 60
pound weight loss over the course of six months from a weight of
greater than 200 pounds, with anorexia, diffuse abdominal pain
for about four months, and some bright red blood per rectum for
approximately two months.

At the outside hospital, head CT showed a multiloculated acute on
chronic subdural hematoma, with an INR of 8.3 and a hematocrit of
24.  Initial management included decadron to decrease brain
edema, phenytoin to decrease the risk of seizure, mannitol to
decrease intracranial pressure, and fresh frozen plasma and
Vitamin K to reverse the coagulation deficit.

The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 363**] and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
neurological checks, neurosurgical evaluation, and serial head
CTs.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Multiple myeloma with light chain
disease for approximately eight years treated with
Thalidomide.  2) Secondary end-stage renal disease, now on
hemodialysis three times per week.  3) Multiple thromboses of
upper extremity AV graft, status post multiple
thrombectomies.  4) SVC syndrome secondary to central line
thrombosis.  5) Hypothyroidism.  6) Chronic anemia.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has GI upset from demerol and
percocet.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  1) Thalidomide 100
mg po qd, 2) ativan with hemodialysis 1 mg tid, 3) Premarin
0.3 mg po qd, 4) Synthroid 0.25 mg po qd, 5) Effexor 150 mg
po qd, 6) Coumadin 2.5 mg po qd, 7) darvocet prn, 8) PhosLo
667 mg po tid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her boyfriend.  Her
daughter lives a few houses away on the same street as her. The
patient is a former [**Hospital6 **] employee where
she worked in Telemetry.  The patient denies any tobacco use. The
patient has a history of alcohol use, but claims to have quit
several years ago.

LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  CBC with a white blood cell
count of 5.6, with a differential of 69 neutrophils, 29.3
lymphocytes, 3 monocytes, 0.8 eosinophils, 1.3 basophils.
Hematocrit 22.0, platelets 85.  Coagulation studies with a PT

amount of blood, 100 protein, pH 8.5, negative for nitrite
and leukocytes.

HEAD CT ON ADMISSION:  A loculated collection, hemorrhage,
probably of different ages in the right temporal lobe,
asymmetry of the lateral ventricles with mass effect on the
right lateral ventricle, effacement with foci in the right
and a small amount of midline shift to the left.

ASSESSMENT:  A 64-year-old female with acute on chronic subdural
hemorrhage secondary to supertherapeutic Coumadin and fall.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for neurological checks,
neurosurgical evaluation, and serial head CTs.  Due to the
multiloculated and small size of the subdural hematoma which was
deemed to be acute on chronic, evacuation by neurosurgery was
deferred, although they continued to follow closely throughout
her admission.  The subdural hematoma was treated conservatively
with decadron to reduce brain edema, rapid correction of the INR
with fresh frozen plasma, platelet transfusion to increase the
platelets and keep the level above 100,000, DDAVP to correct
uremic platelet dysfunction.  Upon presentation, the patient's
neurological exam was nonfocal with a question of left-sided
neglect.  After admission to the MICU, the patient developed a
more obvious left facial droop and decreased movement of the left
extremity.  These neurological symptoms had resolved completely
by the time of discharge.  The patient was monitored with serial
head CT scans, receiving a head CT initially twice a day, then
once per day, and then once every other day.  All of these scans
showed a subdural hemorrhage, stable, from the time of admission.
At the time discharge, the subdural hemorrhage continued to be
stable in size and appearance.  The patient was also noted on EEG
during the admission to have evidence of epileptiform activity.
Therefore, the patient was continued on phenytoin throughout
the admission with modification of the dosing based on free
phenytoin levels.

2) PULMONARY:  After admission to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient became less responsive, agitated, and
tachypneic.  Therefore, the patient was intubated and placed
on a propofol drip.  After the patient's status improved, the
patient was extubated on hospital day #2, and transferred to
the neurological service.  Early on the morning after
transferring to the neurological service, the patient became
again agitated, tachypneic, with oxygen saturations down to the
70s on 100% oxygen via nonrebreather.  The corresponding ABG at
that time was a pH of 7.26, PCO2 47, O2 55.  A code was called at
this point, and the patient was reintubated and transferred back
to the MICU.  Of note, the patient had missed her dialysis
session the previous day due to multiple studies on that day.  In
addition, the patient's previous dialysis session had been cut
short due to studies.  Also, at that time the patient was 10 kg
over her baseline weight.  In addition, the patient had been
maintained on intravenous fluids after admission to the
neurological service.  Therefore, it was felt that the episode of
respiratory failure was most likely due to pulmonary edema in the
setting of volume overload and secondary congestive heart
failure.  With dialysis and careful monitoring of volume status,
the patient improved and was extubated for the second time on
hospital day #5.  After extubation, the patient was noted to
have bulb stridor and wheezing.  The stridor was treated with
racemic epinephrine, heliox, decadron, and a discontinuation
of her ACE inhibitor.  The bronchospasm was responsive to
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.  In addition, the beta
blocker was discontinued for concern of exacerbating
bronchospasm.  After that point, the patient's wheezing steadily
improved and nebulizers were weaned.  At the time of discharge,
the patient was no longer wheezing or requiring nebulizers.

3) HEENT:  Due to the postexpiratory stridor, an
otolaryngological consult was obtained.  Under direct
laryngoscopy, the patient was observed to have erythema and
swelling of the posterior larynx.  This was thought to be
consistent with irritation due to gastroesophageal reflux
disease, in addition to intubation.  The patient's stridor
gradually improved and was completely absent by the time of
discharge.

4) CARDIAC:  Following the episode of respiratory failure,
cardiac enzyme levels were obtained, and the patient was observed
to have a small increase in troponin levels.  This was thought to
be due to cardiac stress in the setting of volume overload, and
the possibility of contribution from coronary artery disease. The
patient was started on low dose aspirin after consultation with
the neurosurgical team. The patient's blood pressure and rate
were controlled with diltiazem.

5) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  After admission to the MICU for the
second time, the patient was noted to have an infiltrate on chest
x-ray which was thought to be consistent with an aspiration
pneumonia.  Therefore, the patient was started on a 7-day course
of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The patient was also noted to have a
urinary tract infection by UA for which the patient was covered
by Levofloxacin.  Blood cultures were obtained in addition to the
urine culture, both of which came back positive for streptococcal
bovis.  Given the association of streptococcal bovis with GI
pathology, in addition to the patient's symptoms of
gastrointestinal bleeding and history of weight loss, abdominal
pain and bright red blood per rectum, there was concern for the
possibility of a GI source of the infection.  The patient was
started on ceftriaxone with plan for at least a 4-week course of
ceftriaxone to cover for the possibility of endocarditis,
especially considering the patient's valvular disease with mitral
regurgitation.  A TTE showed no evidence of vegetations, but a
TEE was declined due to inability to visualize the upper GI tract
and concern for bleeding with a history of black emesis.

6) GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted with a history
of black emesis, in addition to bright red blood per rectum.
As noted above, this in combination with weight loss, abdominal
pain, streptococcal bovis bacteremia, and urinary tract infection
raised concern for the possibility of a gastrointestinal source
such as a colonic malignancy.  It was determined that the patient
would need a colonoscopy to evaluate the lower GI tract, in
addition to an EGD if colonoscopy was negative.  Due to concern
for risk of bleeding, these studies were not performed as an
inpatient.  The plan was to follow-up in two to three weeks with
GI for colonoscopy and EGD.

7) RENAL:  The patient has end-stage renal disease secondary to
light chain multiple myeloma.  The patient was continued on
dialysis three times per week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, during
her admission.  The patient was also started on calcium carbonate
for decreased calcium levels and high phosphate levels.

8) ENDOCRINE:  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is
being maintained on levothyroxine.  Endocrine consult followed
the patient during the admission.  Thyroid function tests were
obtained prior to discharge.  These showed a very low TSH level
and a low T3 level, but these findings were thought to be
unreliable in the acute setting.  It was recommended that the
thyroid function tests be followed up as an outpatient.  In
addition, due to the patient being maintained on dexamethasone,
finger stick blood sugars were obtained daily, and the patient
was on regular insulin sliding scale.

9) HEMATOLOGY:  As noted above, the patient's INR was rapidly
corrected with fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K upon admission.
In addition, the patient's low platelet levels were corrected
with platelet transfusion.  Presumed uremic platelet dysfunction
was treated with DDAVP, as well as dialysis.  All anticoagulation
and antiplatelet agents were initially held.  However, in
addition the patient has a significant history of AV graft
thrombosis and SVC syndrome.  There was concern for procoagulant
risk.  The patient's Thalidomide was discontinued for its
procoagulant effects.  In addition, the patient was started on
low dose aspirin after discovery of slightly increased troponin
levels.  The low dose was later increased to 325 mg qd prior to
discharge in an attempt to decrease the risk of thrombosis.  The
plan at discharge was to hold all additional anticoagulation
until there was radiographic evidence of no repeat subdural
hemorrhage for approximately four weeks.  It was planned for the
patient to have a repeat head CT scan two weeks after discharge.
If that head CT showed no progression of the subdural hematoma
or new bleed, then anticoagulation with Coumadin could be
restarted two weeks later.

10) ONCOLOGY:  The patient has a history of multiple myeloma that
was seen to be active with multiple lytic lesions in the skull
seen on head CT.  The patient's Thalidomide was held due to
procoagulant risk.

11) FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Due to risk of
aspiration, a swallowing study was obtained after the patient was
transferred to the floor on hospital day #5.  This showed no
evidence of aspiration, and the patient was restarted on a full
PO diet.

12) ACCESS:  The patient was given a central line during the stay
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Prior to discharge, the
patient received a PICC line for administration of long-term
ceftriaxone for streptococcal bovis bacteremia.

13) CODE STATUS:  Full.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To acute rehab.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable but in need of close
neurological observation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Subdural hemorrhage secondary to
supertherapeutic Coumadin.  2) Gastrointestinal bleed.  3)
Streptococcal bovis bacteremia.  4) Urinary tract infection.
5) Pulmonary edema.  6) Non-Q wave myocardial infarction, 7)
Aspiration pneumonia.  8) Epileptiform electroencephalogram
activity.  9) Laryngeal edema secondary to gastroesophageal
reflux disease and intubation.  10) Bronchospasm.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) Ceftriaxone 1 gm qd for 26 more
days (total course of 4 weeks), 2) diltiazem 60 mg tid, 3)
pantoprazole 40 mg qd, 4) aspirin 325 mg qd, 5) levothyroxine
25 mcg qd, 6) dexamethasone 2 mg qd for 2 weeks, to be
continued until after repeat head CT in 2 weeks, at that
point a neurologist should be contacted regarding tapering
the dexamethasone, 7) phenytoin 150 mg q am, 200 mg q pm, 8)
calcium carbonate 1,000 mg qd, 9) albuterol/ipratropium
103-18 mcg aerosol 1-2 puffs inhalation q [**4-24**] h prn shortness
of breath or wheezing.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should be followed closely for any
change in neurological status.  Any change (such as focal
signs, increased somnolence) should prompt a repeat head CT to
rule out repeat bleed or increased edema from nontolerance of
dexamethasone tapering.

If the patient is stable, a repeat head CT should be obtained in
two weeks.  If this shows no repeat bleed and gastrointestinal
work-up is negative, then two weeks later (four weeks from
discharge), the patient can be started on anticoagulation again.
Also, based on the level of edema seen on the head CT, the
patient's dexamethasone can be slowly tapered.

Gastrointestinal follow-up needs to be obtained for a colonoscopy
and gastroduodenoscopy in approximately two weeks.  This should
be obtained by calling Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4690**], or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]
at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4692**] to schedule an appointment.  This is to rule
out any gastrointestinal malignancy or gastrointestinal source of
the streptococcal bovis bacteremia, in addition to the
gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient should also follow-up with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], after leaving the acute rehab
setting.  His telephone number is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4693**].

In addition, due to the patient's abnormal thyroid function
tests during this inpatient setting, the patient's thyroid
function tests should be repeated as an outpatient.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please do CT angiogram to evaluate clot burden                                  
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY:  SVC syndrome. ? clot burden.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the
     lung apices after the administration of 100cc of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] fast bolus
     protocol.  Multiplanar reformations were also obtained and reviewed.
     
     COMPARISON:  NONE.
     
     FINDINGS:  The heart, pericardium, and aorta are unremarkable.  There is
     opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree and there are no filling defects
     to suggest pulmonary embolism.  There are scattered areas of patchy and
     nodular pulmonary opacifications bilaterally with some ground glass which
     likely represents an underlying inflammatory process.   There are bilateral
     pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated atelectasis. There
     is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  A prominent node in the right
     axilla is present, a  non-specific finding.  There are no suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     Intravenous contrast was administered via the left arm.  There is
     opacification of the left axillary and subclavian veins as far as the
     clavicular head beyond which there is minimal, if any, contrast flow into the
     left innominate vessel.  There is extensive collateralization of flow through
     the anterior and posterior chest wall and along the phrenic veins with
     ultimate passage of contrast into the azygos vein.  The azygos vein is patent
     and prominent and enters into a patent inferior SVC and ultimately into the
     atrium.  The SVC superior to the junction of the azygos  and SVC appears
     atretic and stenotic which is not would be expected in acute clot.  This
     stenotic appearance extends to the innominate veins bilaterally which measure
     no more than 6 mm in diameter.  Again, these findings are most consistent with
     chronic scarring vs acute clot.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Superior to the azygos/SVC junction and into the innominate veins
     bilaterally, there is stenosis, consistent with chronic scarring with no
     evidence of acute clot burden.  Collateralization of venous flow, as
     described.
     
     2)  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     
     3)  Diffuse apatchy and nodular opacities and scattered ground glass pulmonary
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Subdural hematoma INR 8.4.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3363-3-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is slight decrease in size of the loculated right subdural
     hematoma.  The right frontal and parietal sulci are effaced due to residual
     mass effect from the hemorrhage, as well as possible intrinsic brain edema.
     There is mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle. This appears stable.
     There is minimal leftward shift of the normally midline structures. There are
     no new foci of intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     The osseous structures demonstrate several lucencies within the calvarium
     consistent with patient's multiple myeloma.  There has been interval
     development of a small air fluid level within the sphenoid sinus.  An ET tube
     is present and likely accounts for the presence of the fluid.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There has been slight improvement in the appearance of the right
     subdural hematoma and associated mass effect.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST: The ET tube projects 2.7 cm above the carina.  The heart is
     slightly enlarged.  Compared to the exam of [**3-30**], there has been slight
     increase in upper zone vascular prominence, suggesting worsening CHF.  There
     is probably a small right pleural effusion, though this is difficult to assess
     in the supine position.  Prominence of the right superior mediastinum suggest
     enlargement of azygos vein.  Correlate clinically.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Probable interval worsening in CHF.  ET tube in good position.

     post OG placement.
     
     SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Comparison is made with the study done three hours
     earlier.  The OG tube extends into the stomach.  The endotracheal tube is 2 cm
     above the carina.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Again
     noted is opacity overlying the left lung which may represent aspiration
     pneumonia.  There is mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature which
     could relate to a degree of CHF.  There are no pleural effusions.  Again noted
     is a lucency at the distal aspect of the right clavicle.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Strep bovis bacteremia, question abscess or tumor.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the
     pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of [**Clip Number (Radiology) **] contrast.
     [**Clip Number (Radiology) **] was given due to the patient's debility.  Pre-contrast and early phase
     imaging was obtained through the liver.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are small
     bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis of the adjacent lung.
     The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and loops of small and large
     bowel are normal.  The pancreas contains high-attenuation material consistent
     with dense bile versus sludge.  The kidneys are atrophied bilaterally but they
     are noted to excrete contrast symmetrically.  There is no free fluid, free
     air, or lymph adenopathy and there is no evidence of abscess or inflammatory
     fat stranding.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The sigmoid colon and rectum are
     normal.  The bladder is collapsed by a Foley catheter.  There is a trace
     amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  There is no evidence of abscess.  There
     is no lymph adenopathy.  The trabecular pattern of the iliac bones bilaterally
     is coarsened, a nonspecific finding.  There are no suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic abscess and no evidence of
     malignancy.
     2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
     3.  Atrophic kidneys bilaterally which are noted to excrete contrast.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Follow up acute on chronic subdural hematoma.  ?
     evolving infarct in right temporal lobe.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:
     
     Exam compared to prior studies of [**3363-4-5**] and [**3363-4-1**].
     
     The exam is of improved quality compared to [**4-5**].  There is no definite
     evidence of abnormality in the right temporal lobe to raise the question of
     infarct.  There still is some prominence of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 173**]. There is
     a right-sided convexity subdural with a subtemporal component and a small
     parafalcine component as well.  This appearance is not altered compared to
     [**4-1**].  The degree of right-to-left falcine herniation is unchanged.
     Ventricular dimension is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance when compared to exams back to [**4-1**] with
     persistent right-sided subdural collection as described with some right-to-
     left subfalcine herniation.

     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 710**] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 727**] performed the procedure.  The staff
     radiologis was present and supervising the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient's right upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion.  Ultrasound demonstrates patent compressible right basilic
     vein.  Under sonographic guidance, a 21 gauge needle was used to gain access
     to the basilic vein.  A .018 wire was then advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance into the brachiocephalic vein.  The .018 wire cannot be further
     advanced into the SVC due to the venous stenosis that was demostrated by
     injection of 10 cc Conray through the sheath. The micropuncture needle is
     exchanged for a 4 French peel away sheath and it is determined that a 17 cm
     PICC is needed. The PICC line is trimmed to 17 cm. Under fluoroscopic
     guidance, the PICC is advanced through the peel away sheath and the distal tip
     is positioned in the right axillary vein.  The PICC is demonstrated to flush
     and aspirate well. PICC is stat locked in position. There are no immediate
     complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 17 cm, 4 French single lumen PICC
     through the right basilic vein, with the tip in the right axillary vein.  The
     PICC cannot be advanced into the SVC due to SVC stenosis.  The PICC is ready
     for use.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION: Known subdural hematoma follow up to evaluate for resolution,
     patient to start anticoagulation.
     
     Comparison is made to the head CT from [**3363-4-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS: The previously seen subdural collection is less well visualized on
     today's study suggesting improvement. There is less mass effect on the right
     lateral ventricle, which appears more open on today's study, with only a small
     amount of residual compression on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 173**]. There is no shift of
     normally midline structures on today's study. Visualized near the floor of the
     right middle cranial fossa is a rounded focus of increased attenuation, which
     likely represents blood products. There is no mass effect on the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 173**]
     of the lateral ventricle which is very near to this possible collection. Again
     demonstrated are numerous lytic areas in the calvaria, consistent with the
     patient's known multiple myeloma.
     
     IMPRESSION: Improvement of previously seen subdural collection with less mass
     effect on the right lateral ventricle. A small area of increased attenuation
     persists, likely representing acute blood products, and repeat CT scan is
     recommended for follow up to document complete resolution.
     
     These results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15788**] at the time of interpretation.
