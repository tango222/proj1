DATE OF DEATH:  [**3258-2-21**]

The patient is an 83-year-old patient with multiple medical
problems who presented to [**Hospital1 73**] on [**3258-2-15**], with complaint of intermittent diarrhea,
nausea following a viral URI (treated with Zithromax).  The
patient initially went to an outside hospital where she was
noted to have a K of 10.  She transferred here for a possible
hemodialysis.  At [**Hospital1 4**], the
patient was treated with Kayexalate, bicarbonate, calcium,
D50, insulin and Lasix.  She was also noted to be in acute
renal failure, BUN and creatinine were 122 and 3.4
respectively with a K of 10 and bicarbonate of 9.

The patient is without history of renal insufficiency, it was
thought that the patient's metabolic acidosis was secondary
to severe diarrhea and acute renal failure, was prerenal in
etiology.  In the MICU, K and acidemia improved with
hydration.  The patient also underwent abdominal CT, which
was within normal limits.  The patient was called out of the
MICU on [**3258-2-16**], noted to have improved renal function.
Spironolactone was restarted shortly thereafter on the floor.
The patient's systolic blood pressure was around 90-100 on
the afternoon of [**3258-2-19**], did spike a temperature to 101
associated with shortness of breath and rigors.  Chest x-ray
showed no evidence of CHF or infiltrate.  She was
pancultured.  EKG showed increased rate with no other
changes.  In the evening of [**3258-2-19**], she was noted to be
hypotensive with the BP in the 60s, given fluid boluses,
started on low-dose dopamine and transferred to the MICU.
EKG noted for new onset atrial fibrillation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CHF, EF of 30 percent on 3 liters of
home O2.

Bilateral CEA.

CAD status post CABG, 1996.

Dyslipidemia.

Pacemaker placement status post syncope.

AICD placement status post Vtach, 1999.

Hypertension.

OA.

Hypothyroidism.

Pulmonary hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

TRANSFER MEDICATIONS:  Included Lipitor, sotalol, furosemide,
KCl, metoprolol, levothyroxine, docusate, ASA,
spironolactone, amlodipine, pantoprazole, and heparin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Elderly-appearing female,
uncomfortable.  Temperature was 98.0 degrees, blood pressure
73/30, heart rate 109, respiratory rate 29, O2 saturation was
96 percent on room air and 100 percent on nonrebreather.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRL.  Mucous membranes
were moist.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits, right subclavian line.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Tachy, irregular, S1, S2 with 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
anterolaterally.  Abdomen was obese, soft and nontender,
nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.  EXTREMITIES:  No
CCE.  NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  Cranial nerves II
to XII are grossly  intact, moved all extremities well.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  Relevant data on MICU transfer included
CBC which was essentially within normal limits with the
exception of a creatinine of 1.8.  UA with moderate bacteria
with 42 white blood cells and urine and blood cultures were
pending.  Etiology data was reviewed essentially above.

ASSESSMENT, PLAN AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  An 83-year-old female
with history of cardiac disease admitted to MICU on [**3258-2-15**]
with hyperkalemia, acidemia, and acute renal failure, was
readmitted to the MICU with new onset of atrial fibrillation
with RVR and associated hypotension.  Lab data notable for
UTI and leukocytosis.

Hypotension:  Differential initially included sepsis,
hypovolemia, diuresis, poor forward flow in the setting of
adrenal insufficiency and MI.  The patient was continued on
pressors, and she was originally placed on rule out sepsis.

Plan in addition, urine culture came back positive for fecal
contamination and blood cultures showed gram positive cocci
in clusters and pairs.  Thus she was started on vancomycin
and Levaquin and Flagyl for ? C-difficile after Zithromax.
Left subclavian line was removed and a new line was inserted.
The patient was given a cortisol test, which was not in
keeping with adrenal insufficiency.  No labs are going to be
drawn given family preference given the hypotension and poor
prognosis of this septic patient; this was in context of a
family meeting, [**3258-2-20**], to discuss the plan.  The family
decided on yes antibiotics and supportive care; no lab draws,
no pressors; DNR/DNI.  The patient had been kept on pressors
until this point.

Sepsis:  The fever began to trend down with the treatment
with antibiotics.  Blood cultures were positive in 5 out of 6
bottles.  Levaquin was continued for ? UTI, Flagyl for ? C.
difficile and vancomycin was continued as well.

Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was continued on
amiodarone.  She had the pacer but the ICD was disabled per
family interest and patient's comfort and to avoid shocking
this very ill patient.

Coronary artery disease:  The patient was continued on
aspirin and statin, followed on telemetry.

GI:  Clostridium difficile assay was attempted although the
patient did not have a bowel movement in the final days of
her life and comfort was the main key here.

FEN:  Ad lib given goal of patient comfort.

PPI:  PPX, subcutaneous heparin, PPI.

Communication was with the patient and the daughter.

Respiratory failure:  The patient was hypoxemic and kept on
face mask to keep comfortable.  She did not tolerate BiPAP or
nonrebreather well.  Given the better articulated family
goals and patient's goal, the patient was maintained on
facemask.

DISPOSITION:  Plan was initially to transfer the patient to
the floor, but after a brief stay in the MICU and transfer of
antibiotics to oxacillin on the day of her death.  The
patient was kept in the MICU just for the sake of comfort and
lack of disruption and she passed away on the night of
[**3258-2-21**] with her family and friends at the bedside.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY: 83-year-old woman with acute renal failure, nausea, vomiting
     and abdominal pain with elevated white blood cell count.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     following administration of oral contrast.  No IV contrast was used secondary
     to patient's elevated creatine.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST: There are some dependent changes at the lung
     bases.  The liver, adrenal glands and pancreas are normal in appearance. There
     are some small calcifications seen in the spleen, likely small granulomas. The
     kidneys are atrophic without evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. There
     are gallstones seen in the gallbladder. No pericholecystic fluid is
     identified.  Please note that evaluation of intraabdominal organs is limited
     by the lack of IV contrast.
     
     The aorta and its branches have numerous calcifications seen within them.
     There is a calcification in the right renal artery.
     
     There is no air or free fluid in the abdomen.  The opacified stomach, small
     and large bowel loops are grossly normal.  There is some mild dilatation of
     the large bowel loop, without obstruction and oral contrast reaches the
     sigmoid.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST:
     
     FINDINGS: There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without diverticulitis.
     There is no air or free fluid in the pelvis.  There is a Foley catheter in the
     bladder with some air present in the bladder presumably from Foley catheter
     insertion.  The uterus and adnexa are normal in appearance.  There is no
     significant inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:
     
     FINDINGS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  Degenerative changes are
     seen in the lumbar spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No obstruction.  Oral contrast reaches the sigmoid colon.
                                                                 (Over)
