CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Malaise and chest discomfort.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old
male with coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft in 12/99, with peripheral vascular
disease, chronic renal insufficiency and congestive heart
failure, who is admitted with left sided chest discomfort
today, status post taking Lopressor 50 mg for an episode of
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was in his usual state of
health until today when he visited with a visiting nurse who
noticed an irregularly irregular pulse.  The patient went to
congestive heart failure clinic at [**Hospital6 3163**] where he normally goes.  He was found to be in
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate in the
160s.  He was given Lopressor 50 mg, Coumadin 5 mg and
advised to discontinue his Plavix.  He took the Lopressor of
50 mg at 5:00 p.m.  At 6:00 p.m., he developed chest
tightness, neck tightness and left sided chest pain two out
of ten.  EMS found him with a heart rate of 72 and regular,
blood pressure 60/palpable.  He was brought to the Emergency
Department where he received a bolus of normal saline 500 cc
times one and was placed on a Dopamine drip.

12. Plavix 75 mg q.d. discontinued the day of admission.
13. Torsemide.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Procainamide with
gastrointestinal symptoms, Amiodarone caused agitation and
confusion.  Intravenous dye caused acute renal failure.  The
patient is allergic to shellfish.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his daughter.
He has a past tobacco history and quit.  He has a history of
recent increase in his alcohol consumption, three to five
drinks per day.  His primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5810**].
Cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5811**] and his nurse practitioner [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 2188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5812**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies fever, chills, no
cough, no shortness of breath, no paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, no orthopnea, no lower extremity edema, no angina,
and positive lower extremity cellulitis.  The patient says
this chest pain is the first chest pain he has had in at
least one year and denies any chest pain prior to his
myocardial infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was resting
comfortably in a bed, complaining of mild headache.  Vital
signs revealed pulse 84, blood pressure 95/48 on 5 of
Dopamine, respiratory rate 24, saturating 96% on two liters
nasal cannula.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed moist mucous membranes.  The neck was supple without
jugular venous distention.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular - regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, decreased carotid upstroke and
jugular venous pressure six centimeters.  The abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing with minimal
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, the patient had white count
8.2, hematocrit 39.9, platelets 258,000.  Sodium 138,
potassium 4.9, chloride 102, bicarbonate 16, blood urea
nitrogen 73, creatinine 3.9, glucose 131.  INR was 1.1 and
partial thromboplastin time was 27.4.  The CKs initially was
34 and increased to 38 and troponin was 0.3 increasing to
1.4.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, small left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per
minute with right bundle branch block as well as left
anterior fascicular block, Q wave V1 through V3 and ST
depressions 1.0 millimeter with T wave inversions in V1
through V6 which are old.

OTHER PREVIOUS HISTORY:  The patient has a history of an
ejection fraction of 35% with 3+ mitral regurgitation, status
post coronary artery bypass graft [**11/2661**] and aortic valve
replacement [**11/2661**].  Coronary artery bypass graft anatomy was
left internal mammary artery to the D1, saphenous vein graft
to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
OM1 and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
artery.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 77 year old with coronary
artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, status
post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve
replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dilated
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35% and 3+ mitral
regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency, pulmonary
hypertension with multiple admissions for right greater than
left sided heart failure, status post a recent admission
[**6-14**], to the [**Hospital1 408**] for osteomyelitis complicated by a
bacteremia on a six week course of antibiotics, recently
discontinued two weeks ago, now admitted with hypotension,
chest pain in the setting of a beta blocker, treatment for an
episode of rapid atrial fibrillation [**2663-8-12**], and likely a
hypovolemic state.

1.  Cardiovascular - The patient has known coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction, coronary artery
bypass graft, no angina, with prior myocardial infarction,
aura at home over the last year, presents now with complaints
of chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation and
hypotension, may be related to atrial fibrillation symptoms
or demand ischemia related to decreased blood pressure.
Troponin and CKs were negative on admission.  Troponin
eventually increased to 3.7 possibly consistent with a non Q
wave myocardial infarction secondary to a demand ischemia
from hypotension.

His electrocardiogram was unchanged.  His hypotension may be
secondary to hypovolemia consistent with diarrhea as well as
increasing diuretic dose as well as a beta blocker dose given
yesterday.  The patient is now in normal sinus rhythm.
Quinidine dose was within normal limits at the [**Hospital6 5813**] Clinic yesterday.

The plan is to continue Aspirin and Heparin until rule out
myocardial infarction, titrate off Dopamine as blood pressure
improves with normal saline boluses, hold his ace and
diuretic while hypotensive, continue Quinidine, hold Coumadin
if remains in normal sinus rhythm, consider echocardiogram to
evaluate for any worsening of function to explain worsening
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea symptoms and weight gain,
continue Zocor.

2.  Pulmonary - Pulmonary hypertension reportedly increased
right greater than left sided heart failure symptoms.  The
lungs are clear.  Saturation within normal limits in room
air.

3.  Renal - Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine
around 2.0 at baseline.  Recently worsening secondary to
possibly Vancomycin treatment or Torsemide.  Acute renal
insufficiency on admission here could be consistent with
hypotension in the setting of a prerenal state.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient has a history of chronic
osteomyelitis of the right toes complicated by recent
bacteremia.  No active infection evident at this time.
Hypotension may also represent possible sepsis if infection
inadequately treated.  Will send blood cultures, urine
cultures.  Hold antibiotics at this time.

5.  Gastrointestinal - Epigastric discomfort likely secondary
to gut edema, abdominal distention from right heart failure,
no nausea or vomiting.  Positive diarrhea in the setting of
long antibiotic course.  Reports recent increase in alcohol
use.  Will send C. difficile, guaiac stools, start Zantac,
will check liver function tests given history of ETOH use.

6.  Hematology - The patient has chronic anemia on Procrit.
Hematocrit increased on admission likely reflecting
dehydration.  Platelets and coagulation studies are within
normal limits.  Heparin as above.  Follow hematocrit with
hydration.

7.  Endocrine - On chronic Prednisone for temporal arteritis.
The patient was given stress dose steroids in the Emergency
Department without effect.  Will continue standing dose of
Prednisone.

8.  Prophylaxis - On Zantac and Heparin.

9.  Lines - Will place a left A line, peripheral intravenous
times two, Foley.

10. Disposition - Full code.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was stable after admission
except for mildly decreased systolic blood pressure with
decrease to 70s but responded to a fluid bolus at 4:00 p.m.
The patient continued to be in normal sinus rhythm with
episodes of atrial fibrillation, continued to be treated on
Quinidine and anticoagulation was held.  The patient was
transferred to the floor once he was weaned off Dopamine and
his creatinine began to decrease.

After arrival to the floor on [**2663-8-14**], the patient was
placed on telemetry and noted to have a run of 10 beats of
asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia at 4:00 a.m. on
[**2663-8-15**].  The patient also went into atrial fibrillation
where he remained throughout the remainder of the evening and
morning with rates of between 120 to 160.

The patient was felt to have possible benefit from
electrophysiology study, possibly with an ICD placement.
However, since the patient is mainly followed by cardiology
at [**Hospital6 712**], it was decided to discuss
transferring the patient to the [**Hospital6 712**].

Other recommendations that we were considering at this time
included changing the Quinidine to Dofetilide or seeing if
the patient can tolerate Amiodarone.  Also we discussed the
possibility of placing the patient on Heparin drip if he was
still in atrial fibrillation after 24 hours.

For his coronary artery disease, the patient was continually
treated with Aspirin and Zocor. The patient continued to deny
chest pain although he remained in atrial fibrillation with
increasing rate on movement around the room.

The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, however,
he continued to have good oxygen saturation in room air.

His creatinine decreased throughout the course of the
hospital stay, however, it was still 3.2 on [**2663-8-15**],
continue to hold his ace inhibitor for now.

The patient has a history of osteomyelitis in his right toes.
The patient was started on Keflex during hospitalization
which will be continued for seven days.

The patient had complained of some bloated feeling that he
says he often gets with his congestive heart failure
exacerbation and denies diarrhea.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was decided to be transferred to
[**Hospital6 712**] after attending to attending
conversation and the transfer will probably take place in the
afternoon of [**2663-8-15**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Guarded.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Transferred to [**Hospital6 3163**].
