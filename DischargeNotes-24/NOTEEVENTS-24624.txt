Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left craniotomy and intraparanchymal hematoma evacuation.
 
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 45 year old woman with unknown past medical history 
who presented to [**Hospital1 25**] ED on [**2646-10-2**] as a transfer from 
[**Hospital 5741**] hospital for management of intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage.

History from husband. Patient is a teacher and tonight was 
parent teacher conference night . After that, she went to local 
pub and reportedly had two light beers with coworkers. Back to 
home around 11pm. She and husband were in bedroom watching TV. 
She went to turn TV off with remote control and was having
difficulty using her right hand. Husband sort of chided her for 
this. She apparently tried to talk to him, but words came out 
all ""mumbled"". She then leaned over side of bed and started to 
vomit. He grabbed her garbage can and she held it and continued 
to vomit. She continued to try to talk to him, but was not able 
to get words out. She then ""got a funny look in her eye"" and 
fell
back onto bed and was unresponsive. 

911 called. Intubated in field by EMS. Subsequently found to be
esophageal intubation. Taken to [**Hospital 5741**] hospital.

Arrived at Merrimack just after midnight [**10-2**]. Vitals there 
listed as HR 76, RR 20, BP 137/64, o2 96% on vent. Reintubated 
there at 12:30am after Versed and Succhinylcholine. Head CT 
there with large 4.6 x 5.2 left frontal lobar hemorrhage with 
intraventricular extension. CBC, Chem, Coag within normal 
limits. U/a positive for cocaine metabolites. Received Mannitol 
and Dilantin prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 25**] ED via medflight. No 
meds given during transfer apparently.

Per husband, had been otherwise feeling well in last several 
days. No fevers, chills, headaches, visual changes, numbness, 
weakness.

 
Past Medical History:
1. Migraine headaches; no complaints of headache today
2. Malignant melanoma resected from back 14 years ago; no known
metastasis or recurrence

 
Social History:

abcess, MRI official reading demontrated........

Postoperative day 0 exam; does not follow commands, does not 
open eyes to stimuli, pupils equal(may be slightly large on the 
left) reactive to light.Localizing bilateral upper extremities 
to noxious, W/D bilateral lower extremities to noxious stimuli. 
Toes downgoing bilaterally. 

Postoperative day 1 exam; Patient remains intubated and sedated, 
propofol off for thirty minutes prior to exam.  PERRL 4-2mm 
Bilat, no spontaneous eye opening, but does with noxious 
stimuli, withdraws to noxious stimuli in all four extremities.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient is status post left frontal craniotomy for
     hemorrhage with history of melanoma, rule out tumor versus AVM.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1-sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
     axial images were obtained before gadolinium.  T1-axial, coronal, and sagittal
     images were obtained following gadolinium.  Correlation was made with the head
     CT of [**2646-10-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with post-
     surgical changes and blood products in that region.  Blood products are also
     seen in the ventricles and also in the interhemispheric region. Following
     gadolinium, no distinct enhancement is seen at the surgical site. However,
     there is an approximately 1 cm area of enhancement seen in the left parietal
     lobe consistent with metastatic disease.  No definite other areas of abnormal
     enhancement is seen.  Small amount of blood is seen in the subarachnoid space.
     There is no hydrocephalus seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Postoperative changes in the left frontal lobe following
     evacuation of intracerebral hematoma.  No distinct residual enhancement is
     seen in this region.  Small approximately 1 cm area of enhancement with mild
     surrounding edema is seen in the left parietal lobe consistent with metastatic
     disease.  No abnormal vascular structures are identified.

     placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
     was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
     1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
     Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
     out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
     saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
     continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4526**] [**Last Name (un) **] was introduced
     and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 unitsof
     heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     History of intracranial hemorrhage.  To rule out vascular malformation.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient???s
     family after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
     Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or
     permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed. 
     
     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
     placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
     was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
     1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
     Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
     out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
     saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
     continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4526**] [**Last Name (un) **] was introduced
     and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 unitsof
     heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

     MRI OF BRAIN
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient is status post left frontal craniotomy for
     hemorrhage with history of melanoma, rule out tumor versus AVM.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1-sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
     axial images were obtained before gadolinium.  T1-axial, coronal, and sagittal
     images were obtained following gadolinium.  Correlation was made with the head
     CT of [**2646-10-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with post-
     surgical changes and blood products in that region.  Blood products are also
     seen in the ventricles and also in the interhemispheric region. Following
     gadolinium, no distinct enhancement is seen at the surgical site. However,
     there is an approximately 1 cm area of enhancement seen in the left parietal
     lobe consistent with metastatic disease.  No definite other areas of abnormal
     enhancement is seen.  Small amount of blood is seen in the subarachnoid space.
     There is no hydrocephalus seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Postoperative changes in the left frontal lobe following
     evacuation of intracerebral hematoma.  No distinct residual enhancement is
     seen in this region.  Small approximately 1 cm area of enhancement with mild
     surrounding edema is seen in the left parietal lobe consistent with metastatic
     disease.  No abnormal vascular structures are identified.

     Left vertebral artery.
     
     Evaluation of the above blood vessels demonstrates no definite evidence of
     abnormal vascular malformation or aneurysm.  No significant atherosclerotic
     stenosis noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     No abnormal vascularity or aneurysm noted.  A repeat angiogram may be
     performed in four to six weeks as clinically warranted to exclude subtle
     abnormality.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  45-year-old woman with large intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Head CT without contrast.  There are no prior examinations
     available for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
     extension along the white matter tracts lateral to the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 79**]. The
     main part of the hematoma is roughly 5cm in dimension.  Mass effect causes
     obliteration of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 79**] and about 7 mm of contralateral shift of
     the normally midline structures. There is also medial displacement of the left
     uncus with obliteration of the basal cisterns and widening of the right
     temporal [**Doctor Last Name 79**].  This indicates transtentorial hernaition. There is extension
     of hemorrhage into all the ventricles.
     
     The [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-white differentiation is preserved.  The surrounding soft tissue and
     osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension
     into the ventricles with mass effect resulting in subfalcine and
     transtentorial herniation. Additional information added to this report was
     discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4523**] at 9:12am on [**2646-10-2**].  There had already been
     decompression of the frontal lobe hematoma.

     INDICATION:  Tube placement.
     
     CHEST AP:  Patient is slightly rotated. The tip of the endotracheal tube is
     about 3 cm above the carina. The tip of the feeding tube is the stomach.  The
     heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The lungs are
     clear. There are no pleural effusions.  A hiatal hernia is noted. There is an
     opacity in the left perihilar region. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The
     surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the left perihilar region with volume loss, which may
     be due to atelectasis or aspiration. This is difficult to assess due to
     rotation of the patient. Attention to this area should be made in subsequent
     examinations to ensure resolution

     FINDINGS:  Postoperative changes are seen in the left frontal lobe.  Small
     amount of blood and mild surrounding hypodensity due to edema are seen in this
     region.  Since the previous study, the blood products have not significantly
     changed, and there has been resolution of pneumocephalus.  Small amount of
     blood is still seen in the ventricles and in the subarachnoid space.  No mass
     effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus identified.

     pneumocephalus compared with the previous study.  Left frontal
     intraparenchymal blood products and ventricular and subarachnoid blood are
     again noted.  No hydrocephalus.
