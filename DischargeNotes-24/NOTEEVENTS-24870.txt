CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fluid overload.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year-old gentleman
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft, atrial fibrillation, congestive
heart failure, with ejection fraction about 10 to 15%
followed by the Heart Failure Clinic who presented with
congestive heart failure exacerbation.  He was initially
admitted to Coronary Care Unit for Swan-Ganz placement and
diuresis with Nitrocor.  He had gained about 15 pounds from
his baseline and he has been feeling lousy for the past two
weeks prior to his admission.  He complained of increased
dyspnea on exertion, unable to climb six stairs without
stopping.  He has been on congestive heart failure diet with
fluid restriction.  He has been drinking less then 1 to 1.5
liters of fluid a day and takes less then 2 grams of sodium a
day.  He denies episodes of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, but did report getting up one to two times per day
to urinate.  He also had occasional nonproductive cough, but
denied any fevers or chills or night sweats.  He has had
constipation for which he took two Fleet's enemas [**4-2**]
with good relief.  His last bowel movement was the day before
admission.  He denies nausea, vomiting, bleeding per rectum.
He also reports a brief episode of associated chest pain
starting from the left side radiating to the right side.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction 10 to
15%.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft with redo in [**3404**], saphenous vein graft to left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Chronic renal failure.
6.  Post polio syndrome at age 5.
7.  Mitral and tricuspid valvuloplasty.
8.  AV block status post pacer placement in [**3405-2-11**]
upgraded to ICD and biventricular pacer in [**3407-1-11**].
9.  Type 1 diabetes.
10.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
11.  Peripheral neuropathy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Bumex 3 mg po b.i.d., Hydralazine
40 mg q.i.d., Imdur 30 mg q.d., Coreg 3.125 mg po b.i.d.,
Protonix 40 mg po q.d., Synthroid 25 micrograms po q.d.,
Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d., Neurontin 100 mg po q.d., aspirin
81 mg po q day, Coumadin one tablet po q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  Lipitor and Welchol with arthralgias.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 122/64.  Heart rate 70.
O2 sat 96% on room air.  Respirations 12.  Weight 85.5
kilograms.  General lying in bed in no acute distress.  Head
and neck examination oropharynx is clear.  JVP 11 cm up to
the earlobe.  Cardiovascular distant heart sounds, S1 and S2
present.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen
slightly distended, nontender, nondistended.  Well healed
scar appendectomy and hernia repair.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities 2+ pitting edema up to the knees bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 128, potassium 3.9,
chloride 86, bicarb 29, BUN 72, creatinine 2.9, glucose 79,
ALT 32, AST 24, albumin 3.8, calcium 8.5, phos 4.3, magnesium
2.3, alkaline phosphatase 162.  Total bilirubin .7, CK of
653, PT 18.2, PTT 35.6, INR 2.2, white blood cell count of
7.9, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 188, MCV 85.  Chest x-ray
upper zone vascular redistribution.  No overt evidence of
pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit for possible Swan-Ganz placement and
Nitrocor for diuresis, however, the placement of Swan-Ganz
was deferred secondary to the recent placement of
biventricular pacemaker.  Since the patient had a good
diuresing effect with intravenous Bumex and nitro drip he was
transferred to the CMED Service for further diuresis on nitro
drip and Bumex.  The diuresing effect of nitro drip and
intravenous Bumex slowed down after a few days with good
response.  He was then started on Nitrocor for further
diuresing.  Although his weight remained kind of stable,
clinically he looked much better with continuous 1 to 1.5
liter negative of ins and outs per day.  Since his TSH and
free T4 were on the low side his Levothyroxine was increased
to 50 micrograms po q day.  His TSH should be rechecked in
four to six weeks to ensure adequate replacement.  He also
received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a low
hematocrit of 28.  He was started on Epogen and iron
supplements for anemia of iron deficiency and chronic renal
insufficiency.  His renal function also improved
significantly after aggressive diuresing.  His creatinine
went down to 1.9 on the day of discharge.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure exacerbation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coreg 3.125 mg po b.i.d., Protonix 40
mg po q day, Amiodarone 200 mg po q day, Neurontin 100 mg po
q day, aspirin 81 mg po q day, Levothyroxine 15 micrograms po
q day, Warfarin one tablet po q.h.s.  The patient was told to
resume his regular Coumadin dose.  Lovenox 60 mg subQ b.i.d.
until INR greater then 2.  Iron sulfate 325 mg po q day,
Bumex 3 mg po b.i.d., Hydralazine 25 mg po q.i.d., Imdur 30
mg po q.d., Epogen 5000 units subQ three times a week,
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
congestive heart failure clinic on [**3407-4-28**] at 9:30
a.m..  He will also continue to follow up with his primary
care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will have his INR checked on Wednesday
[**4-15**] of 2003 and have his TSH checked in four weeks.
Since the patient has significant coronary artery disease and
congestive heart failure starting the patient on an ace
inhibitor and statin would be beneficial as an outpatient.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     Compared to [**3407-1-27**].
     
     INDICATION: Weight gain in patient with congestive heart failure.
     
     The heart demonstrates left ventricular enlargement. The aorta is slightly
     tortuous. The pulmonary vascularity shows slight upper zone redistribution.
     There is no overt evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions are
     evident, but the right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the study,
     and cannot be assessed.
     
     An ICD remains in place with 4 leads. One of the leads has an unusual
     orientation, possibly due to biventricular pacing. This appears unchanged.
     
     Note is made of prior median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.
     
     IMPRESSION: Upper zone vascular redistribution, but no overt evidence of
     pulmonary edema.
