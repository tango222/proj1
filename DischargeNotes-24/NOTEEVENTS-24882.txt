Admission Date:  [**2601-2-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2601-2-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2543-7-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Fernard Intensive Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 2932**] is a 57-year-old
male who presented to [**Hospital 770**] Hospital on [**2601-2-17**] with
hematemesis.  The patient was treated with transfusions and
octreotide.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done with
unsuccessful therapeutic treatment of upper gastrointestinal
bleed.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 73**] [**2601-2-18**], with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6240**] for transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure.

Indications included gastric variceal bleed that was
refractory to endoscopic treatment.  The patient was
electively intubated prior to transfer.

On [**2601-2-19**], the patient had a transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt procedure complicated by innominate vein
perforation right internal mammary artery bleed with
hemothorax.  The patient was taken to the operating room for
sternotomy with repair of vascular lesions.  The patient was
stabilized, and a chest tube placed.  The patient required 12
units of packed red blood cells, and 4 units of platelets,
and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.

After initial period of stability, the patient became
increasingly hypotensive from [**2601-2-21**] to [**2601-2-23**]
requiring pressor support.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed
and his systemic vascular resistance was decreased, and the
cardiac output and index were increased.  The patient was
transferred to the Fernard Intensive Care Unit for further
care given picture of sepsis.

Of note, his packed red blood cell requirement has been
3 units per day over three days and has stopped bleeding
clinically.  There was no nasogastric tube output.  The
patient still had [**Last Name (un) 6240**] tube in place.  The patient is
paralyzed due to difficulty with ventilation postoperatively.

In the operating room on [**2-19**], the patient had an episode
of hypotension for about one to three minutes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cirrhosis.
2.  Status post esophageal variceal bleed.
3.  Status post transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
which was unsuccessful.
4.  Status post innominate vein and right internal mammary
artery laceration with resultant hemothorax.
5.  Status post sternotomy as described.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer from
Surgical Intensive Care Unit were octreotide 50 mcg q.d.,
insulin drip, Dilaudid drip, Ativan drip, oxacillin 2 g
q.6h., levofloxacin 500 mg intravenously q.d., Flagyl 500 mg
intravenously t.i.d., Protonix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.,
Cisatracurium 80 mcg/kg per hour, Neo-Synephrine drip.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Blood pressure
was 110/50, pulse was 80, temperature was 37.  The patient
was on ventilatory support on AC 550 X 12 with an FIO2
of 60%, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 20.
Swan-Ganz catheter readings as follows:  Central venous
pressure 22, pulmonary artery pressure 44/19, cardiac output
of 7.8, cardiac index was 3.95, systemic vascular resistance
was 522.  Ins-and-outs 2700 in and 1800 out; 1300 of that
urine.  In general, the patient was intubated and sedated.
Pupils were small and reactive.  Neck revealed left internal
jugular in place; the site looks clean.  The oropharynx was
clear.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6240**] was in place; some purulent green
discharge noted.  Chest revealed fair breath sounds
bilaterally, positive rhonchi throughout.  Cardiovascular had
a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities were
warm with fair pulses distally.  Skin had no rash.  Right
radial and femoral lines with no purulent discharge noted
from either line.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count was 13.4 (decreased from 19.6), hematocrit was 33.4,
platelets were 146.  PT was 15.4, PTT was 42.2, INR was 1.7.
Chemistry-7 significant for a creatinine of 1.5 (increased
from baseline of 1).  Albumin was 2.7, phosphate was 4.5,
magnesium was 2.1.  ALT was 19, AST was 32, alkaline
phosphatase was 108, total bilirubin was 13.1 (increased from
admission of 6).  Urine sodium was 19 on [**2601-2-20**].
Arterial blood gas revealed 7.4, PCO2 was 34, PO2 was 135,
unknown FIO2, lactate was 3.  Blood cultures revealed no
growth to date so far.  Sputum was positive for
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray revealed bilateral
infiltrates suggestive of congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 57-year-old male with
recent gastric variceal bleed, status post unsuccessful
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt complicated by
hemothorax and innominate vein injury requiring
thoracotomy, now hypotensive on pressors requiring increased
FIO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure to maintain
oxygenation.

His Swan-Ganz catheter numbers and physical with complete
blood count and increased white blood cell count with left
shift were suggestive of sepsis.  The patient was paralyzed
due to difficulty with ventilation postoperatively.  The
patient seemed to no longer bleeding from his varices.

1.  PULMONARY:  Given decreased blood pressure we tried to
decrease the positive end-expiratory pressure as tolerated
and tried to wean off the paralytics.  The patient was also
given fluid to maintain his blood pressure.  Diuresis was not
an option given decreased blood pressure.  A Swan-Ganz
catheter was placed perioperatively and was subsequently
discontinued.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was requiring Neo-Synephrine
to increase his blood pressure.  We tried to wean the
Neo-Synephrine and add vasopressin; however, this was
unsuccessful.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had a stable hematocrit
and no longer had a transfusion requirement.  The patient was
continued on Protonix, and the [**Last Name (un) 6240**] tube continued to be
left in.  The patient had hyperbilirubinemia; most likely
thought secondary to shocked liver given episode of
hypotension.

4.  RENAL:  Creatinine had increased to 1.5 and continued to
increase during the hospitalization.  It was thought most
likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.  The patient
continued to maintain a good urine output.  On [**3-7**], the
patient was started on octreotide and midodrine given the
possibility of hepatorenal syndrome; however, his creatinine
continued to increase.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was maintained on an insulin drip
which was later changed to subcutaneous.

6.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable.
His coagulopathy was most likely secondary to his liver
disease.

7.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Oxacillin was changed to vancomycin
given that the patient continued to be febrile.  It was also
thought that the patient may have a sinusitis secondary to
the [**Last Name (un) 6240**] tube; however, Gastroenterology felt that the
[**Last Name (un) 6240**] tube should be kept in given his recent episode of
upper gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient was continued on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
Flagyl for general sepsis to cover for sinusitis, and
mediastinitis, and Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum.

8.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was initiated
on total parenteral nutrition.

The patient did not significantly improve, and given
worsening renal function, it was thought that the patient's
prognosis was very poor.  After a family meeting, the patient
was made do not resuscitate.

On [**2-27**], given the poor prognosis, the family decided to
make the patient comfort measures only.  At 11:58, the
patient expired.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Gastric variceal bleed secondary to cirrhosis.
2.  Cirrhosis; most likely secondary to ethanol use.
3.  Hemothorax secondary to transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt procedure; status post sternotomy and
stabilization of perforations.
4.  Sepsis.
5.  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

     CHEST AP:
     
     Comparison is made to the prior film dated [**2601-2-18**]. There is evidence of
     multiple sternal wires and surgical clips along the sternum, suggestive of
     recent sternotomy. There is interval placement of a right sided chest tube,
     which seems to be in good position. Also noted is evidence of an ETT, with the
     tip in close proximity to the carina. However, due to the overlying hardware,
     the exact location is difficult to assess. Note is also made of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
     balloon, overlying the region of cardia and fundus of the stomach. Again noted
     is evidence of right lower lobe collapse/consolidation. There is some residual

     HISTORY:  The patient was undergoing a TIPS procedure.  During access of the
     right internal jugular vein, a large right mediastinal bleed developed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was already under general anesthesia.  The procedure
     was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 812**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**] had already placed a
     pigtail catheter into the right brachiocephalic vein from a right transfemoral
     approach.  I performed a hand injection which demonstrated that there was no
     major disruption in this vessel.  Therefore, the decision was made to proceed
     with arterial catheterization.  The right femoral artery was entered with a
     19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 767**] guide wire, a 5-French sheath was placed,
     followed by a 5-French pigtail catheter.  It was advanced into the ascending
     aorta and an aortogram in LAO projection was performed.  The catheter was then
     exchanged for a headhunter catheter which was brought over a Glidewire
     selectively into the right brachiocephalic artery and an arteriogram was done
     in LAO projection and [**Doctor Last Name 3092**] projection.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath
     was sutured to the skin and signed out to care of Anesthesia.  The venous
     catheter was exchanged for a trauma venous line.  It was flushed and sutured
     to the skin and also signed out to Anesthesia for continued care.
     
     FINDINGS:  The films demonstrate an endotracheal tube with its tip two fingers
     above the carina in good positioning.  A Sengstaken tube is in place.  There
     is a bovine aortic arch with a common take-off of the brachiocephalic and left
     carotid artery.  Of note is extravasation from the distal portion of the right
     brachiocephalic artery.  There is also a widening of the right pleural space
     compatible with a right pleural hematoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Injury to the distal right brachiocephalic artery with
     extravasation.

     in LAO projection and [**Doctor Last Name 3092**] projection.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath
     was sutured to the skin and signed out to care of Anesthesia.  The venous
     catheter was exchanged for a trauma venous line.  It was flushed and sutured
     to the skin and also signed out to Anesthesia for continued care.
     
     FINDINGS:  The films demonstrate an endotracheal tube with its tip two fingers
     above the carina in good positioning.  A Sengstaken tube is in place.  There
     is a bovine aortic arch with a common take-off of the brachiocephalic and left
     carotid artery.  Of note is extravasation from the distal portion of the right
     brachiocephalic artery.  There is also a widening of the right pleural space
     compatible with a right pleural hematoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Injury to the distal right brachiocephalic artery with
     extravasation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient was undergoing a TIPS procedure.  During access of the
     right internal jugular vein, a large right mediastinal bleed developed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was already under general anesthesia.  The procedure
     was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 812**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**] had already placed a
     pigtail catheter into the right brachiocephalic vein from a right transfemoral
     approach.  I performed a hand injection which demonstrated that there was no
     major disruption in this vessel.  Therefore, the decision was made to proceed
     with arterial catheterization.  The right femoral artery was entered with a
     19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 767**] guide wire, a 5-French sheath was placed,
     followed by a 5-French pigtail catheter.  It was advanced into the ascending
     aorta and an aortogram in LAO projection was performed.  The catheter was then
     exchanged for a headhunter catheter which was brought over a Glidewire
     selectively into the right brachiocephalic artery and an arteriogram was done
     in LAO projection and [**Doctor Last Name 3092**] projection.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath
     was sutured to the skin and signed out to care of Anesthesia.  The venous
     catheter was exchanged for a trauma venous line.  It was flushed and sutured
     to the skin and also signed out to Anesthesia for continued care.
     
     FINDINGS:  The films demonstrate an endotracheal tube with its tip two fingers
     above the carina in good positioning.  A Sengstaken tube is in place.  There
     is a bovine aortic arch with a common take-off of the brachiocephalic and left
     carotid artery.  Of note is extravasation from the distal portion of the right
     brachiocephalic artery.  There is also a widening of the right pleural space

     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  57 year old male with esophageal varices and bleeding
     from gastric varices refractory to sclerotherapy and banding.  TIPS is
     necessary to control hemorrhage.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending Radiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2234**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 489**], Interventional
     Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4251**] [**Name (STitle) **], Interventional Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3539**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from the family by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 489**] was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     The patient was placed in supine position with the right neck sterilely
     prepped and draped.  Anesthesia was present to perform general anesthesia.
     Ultrasound was used to visualize the right internal jugular vein.  After local
     anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a 19-gauge needle was placed under sonographic
     guidance into the jugular vein.  A .035 J-tipped Amplatz wire was advanced
     through the needle under fluoroscopic observation.  A 10-French long sheath
     was placed over the wire under fluoroscopic observation.  It was noted under
     fluoroscopy that the sheath appeared to deviate from the expected course of
     the superior vena cava.  The wire was removed, and contrast injected into the
     sheath as it was retracted.  A flash of contrast was seen to suggest its
     presence in the jugular vein, but no further evidence of the sheath being
     intravascular was evident.  The sheath was complete removed and manual
     pressure applied at the right neck site until hemostasis was achieved.  The
     patient proceeded to have the right groin sterilely prepped and draped.  The
     right common femoral vein was accessed using a 19-gauge single-wall needle,
     through which [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 767**] guide wire was placed into the inferior vena cava.
     Over this wire under fluoroscopic observation, a 5-French pigtail catheter was
     advanced into the right brachiocephalic vein, and contrast injected.  These
     contrast injections revealed no injury to the venous structures that was
                                                                 (Over)

     discernible.  An angiogram of the right brachiocephalic artery was performed
     at this point (see separate dictation).  The femoral access had a sheath
     placed over it per Anesthesia recommendation, and the patient was sent to the
     O.R. requiring pressors to maintain hemodynamic stability.  The previous
     hemodynamic instability requiring the patient to be put on pressors was likely
     secondary to vascular injury, given widening of the mediastinum and increasing
     density at the right hemithorax, as seen under fluoroscopy.  The
     Cardiothoracic Surgery Service and Vascular Surgery Service were immediately
     called upon findings and observation for consultation and emergent vascular
     repair, if necessary.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Local anesthesia consisted of 1% lidocaine.  The Anesthesia
     Service was present for general anesthesia.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  The patient had a right-sided hemothorax and hemomediastinum
     from vascular injury during the procedure.  While during the procedure it was
     
     uncertain the exact nature of the vascular injury, only that it was arterial.
     The patient was sent to the Operating Room at which time the report showed a
     small puncture wound at the superior vena cava, with avulsion injury to the
     inferior mesenteric artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4251**] [**Name (STitle) **], Interventional Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3539**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from the family by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 489**] was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     The patient was placed in supine position with the right neck sterilely
     prepped and draped.  Anesthesia was present to perform general anesthesia.
     Ultrasound was used to visualize the right internal jugular vein.  After local
     anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a 19-gauge needle was placed under sonographic
     guidance into the jugular vein.  A .035 J-tipped Amplatz wire was advanced
     through the needle under fluoroscopic observation.  A 10-French long sheath
     was placed over the wire under fluoroscopic observation.  It was noted under
     fluoroscopy that the sheath appeared to deviate from the expected course of
     the superior vena cava.  The wire was removed, and contrast injected into the
     sheath as it was retracted.  A flash of contrast was seen to suggest its
     presence in the jugular vein, but no further evidence of the sheath being
     intravascular was evident.  The sheath was complete removed and manual
     pressure applied at the right neck site until hemostasis was achieved.  The
     patient proceeded to have the right groin sterilely prepped and draped.  The
     right common femoral vein was accessed using a 19-gauge single-wall needle,
     through which [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 767**] guide wire was placed into the inferior vena cava.
     Over this wire under fluoroscopic observation, a 5-French pigtail catheter was
     advanced into the right brachiocephalic vein, and contrast injected.  These
     contrast injections revealed no injury to the venous structures that was
                                                                 (Over)

     discernible.  An angiogram of the right brachiocephalic artery was performed
     at this point (see separate dictation).  The femoral access had a sheath
     placed over it per Anesthesia recommendation, and the patient was sent to the
     O.R. requiring pressors to maintain hemodynamic stability.  The previous
     hemodynamic instability requiring the patient to be put on pressors was likely
     secondary to vascular injury, given widening of the mediastinum and increasing
     density at the right hemithorax, as seen under fluoroscopy.  The
     Cardiothoracic Surgery Service and Vascular Surgery Service were immediately
     called upon findings and observation for consultation and emergent vascular
     repair, if necessary.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Local anesthesia consisted of 1% lidocaine.  The Anesthesia
     Service was present for general anesthesia.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  The patient had a right-sided hemothorax and hemomediastinum
     from vascular injury during the procedure.  While during the procedure it was
     
     uncertain the exact nature of the vascular injury, only that it was arterial.
     The patient was sent to the Operating Room at which time the report showed a
     small puncture wound at the superior vena cava, with avulsion injury to the
     inferior mesenteric artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Attempted TIPS procedure resulting in injury to the right internal mammary
     artery; patient was sent to the O.R. for operative repair.
