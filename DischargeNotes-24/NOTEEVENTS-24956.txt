HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6416**] is a 77-year-old woman
with a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease,
congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure (with one
kidney) who presents from primary care physician's office
with a chief complaint of dyspnea.  She was being seen for
management of congestive heart failure.

She had been having increased dyspnea and orthopnea dating
back to [**3159-9-25**] with worsening symptoms over the
past week; increased fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, nausea,
vomiting, weakness, and orthopnea.  She also reports
pleuritic chest pain, decreased oral intake, and left-sided
abdominal pain.  Her chest pain is both at rest and with
activity.  Decreased activity capacity over approximately
seven days.  She has been having worsening renal function
over the past three months or so.

On the floor, when she was admitted to the [**Doctor Last Name 2451**] team, she
was found to have a potassium of 7 and a bicarbonate of 10.
Bradycardic with widened QRS.  Digoxin level was 4.8.  She
was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/40 and was 97% on
room air.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and underwent dialysis.  Found to have an INR of
approximately 8 possible secondary to the medications that
she had been taking; however, the patient was unclear what
medicine she had been taking.  She had been given vitamin A
and fresh frozen plasma times two.  She also had negative
creatinine kinases times three and ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6416**] spent an evening in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and then was transferred out to the
[**Hospital1 **] team.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history is notable for)
 1.  Atrial fibrillation and rheumatic heart disease (class
III).
 2.  Congestive heart failure.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Diastolic function.
 5.  Mitral regurgitation (3+), mitral stenosis, and aortic
regurgitation; all secondary to rheumatic heart disease.
 6.  She has diverticulitis; status post colectomy.
 7.  She has chronic renal insufficiency; she had been
started on an ACE inhibitor approximately six months ago.
 8.  She is status post nephrectomy (which is old).
 9.  She has had a history of basal cell carcinoma; status
post resection.
10.  She is status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
11.  She has gout.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications on admission were
Vioxx 12.5, warfarin 2.5, Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice per day,
lisinopril 40 mg p.o. once per day (this was started in
[**3159-9-25**]), digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. once per day,
allopurinol 100 mg p.o. every day, Lasix 40 mg p.o. once per
day, and triamterene.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to SULFA as well as to MOTRIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at home with daughter who assists
her with her medications.  She does not smoke.  She does not
drink alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   She reports increased shortness of
breath, orthopnea, and chest pain times four months.  Nausea
and vomiting times four weeks and diarrhea.  No fevers or
chills.  No falls.  No bright red blood per rectum.  She
denies melena.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination on
transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] team, her blood pressure was 84 to
91/30 to 50.  She was pale and in no acute distress.  Her
heart rate was 90 to 100, a regular rate and rhythm.  She was
97% on 4 liters.  She had pale conjunctivae.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.   Mucous membranes were
moist.  Her neck was supple.  Her jugular venous pulsation
was up to her mandible.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm with
a III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal
border and right upper sternal border.  She had a III/VI left
upper sternal border systolic ejection murmur to the axilla.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.  The abdomen
was nontender with normal active bowel sounds.  Her abdomen
was soft.  She had trace to 1+ lower extremity edema.  Her
cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  She had no flank
ecchymosis or tenderness.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  On [**2-4**],
she had a white blood cell count of 9.8, hematocrit was 29.4,
and platelets were 264.  INR was 7.9.  Sodium was 134,
potassium was 7, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 10, blood
urea nitrogen was 163, creatinine was 10.8, and blood glucose
was 120.  Calcium was 8.9, phosphorous was 11.5, and
magnesium was 2.6.

Her laboratories on [**4-6**] revealed white blood cell count
was 6, hemoglobin was 8.5, hematocrit was 24.4, and platelets
were 167.  INR was 2.4.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone was
0.92.  Sodium was 137, potassium was 4, chloride was 102,
bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 93, and
creatinine was 6.5 (this was after dialysis).  Creatinine
kinases were 47, 30, and 28.  Calcium was 8.6, phosphorous
was 7.9, and magnesium was 1.9.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  She had a KUB on [**3160-2-4**]
which showed a small-bowel resection in the pelvis.
Small-bowel distention may indicate the presence of early
obstruction given dilation down to the levels of earlier
surgery.  A follow-up KUB should be obtained if symptoms
persist.  She had a renal ultrasound on [**2-4**] as well.
Impression was no hydronephrosis.

An abdominal ultrasound on [**2-10**]; probable simple left
cyst.  Liver demonstrates coarse echogenicity without focal
mass or hepatic ductal dilatation.  The kidney was 10.6 with
a 2.6 cm cyst which is probably simple.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a
77-year-old woman with severe valvular disease, chest
pain/pressure, dyspnea on exertion and at rest, fatigue, and
found to be in acute renal failure, hypotensive, status post
dialysis, with a persistent low blood pressure.  Hematocrit
was 24.4 of unclear etiology.

1.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Hematocrit was down to 24.4 in the
context of an elevated INR.  The patient received 2 units of
fresh frozen plasma and 1 unit of vitamin K.  Her Coumadin
was held.  She was typed and crossed 2 units.  She was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit
jumped to 32.9.  Stools were guaiac-positive.  History of
diverticulosis with a supratherapeutic INR on presentation.

Gastroenterology was consulted who recommended an outpatient
colonoscopy as there were no signs of brisk bleed, and the
patient's hematocrit was stable for greater than 48 hours
status post the initial transfusion.  Liver function tests
were within normal limits.

The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound, as stated
earlier above.  Her INR was 1.7 on the day of discharge.  She
was started back on her Coumadin at 2.5 mg when her INR was
1.7.  She was to follow up with both her primary care
physician and the Congestive Heart Failure Clinic shortly
after discharge as well as to have Visiting Nurse Association
to come to the house and monitor her INR.  The patient was to
have an outpatient colonoscopy to follow up on the
guaiac-positive stools in the context of a very
supratherapeutic INR.  Iron studies were consistent with iron
deficiency anemia.  The patient was discharged on iron
supplements.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Congestive heart failure:
Initially the patient had hypotesion and was not given any
treatment for her congestive heart failure after the blood
transfusion and improvement of the patient's blood pressure
to 120 to 145/50 to 60.  The patient was started on
intravenous Lasix 40 by 20 intravenously then converted over
to 40 p.o. every day.   The patient was initially started on
nitrate for afterload reduction.  This was converted to oral
nitrates and hydralazine.  An ACE inhibitor was initially not
used given the patient's elevated creatinine.  The goal will
be to start an ACE inhibitor and place on hydralazine and
nitrates when the patient's creatinine is less than 1.5.
When the patient was euvolemic, her beta blocker was titrated
up for rhythm control for atrial fibrillation.  This was
titrated up to 37.5 on the day of discharge on 50 p.o.

The main issue and etiology of her heart failure that needed
addressing was of course her rheumatic heart disease.
Repeatedly during the admission, the patient refused surgery
at the current time and preferred to have medical management.
The Congestive Heart Failure Service assisted us with this
medical management.  The patient was to follow up with the
Congestive Heart Failure Service as an outpatient, at which
time an ACE inhibitor will be added to her regimen.

An echocardiogram on [**3160-2-5**] showed an ejection
fraction of 65% and P-R gradient of approximately 32 mmHg.
The left atrium was markedly dilated.  The right atrium was
markedly dilated.  The ventricular wall thickness was normal.
The left ventricular cavity size was normal.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function was normal, greater than 55%.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were
normal.  The aortic root was normal in diameter.  Mild
thickening of the aortic valve, 1+ aortic regurgitation, 3+
mitral regurgitation, with moderate mitral stenosis, 1+
tricuspid regurgitation.  No pericardial effusion.

(b)  Rate control:  For atrial fibrillation; her heart rate
initially was 100 when she came out of the Unit.  Beta
blocker was titrated up as the patient was diuresed, and on
the day of discharge her heart rate was in the low 90s, and
her blood pressure was 112/70.

2.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was initially dialyzed and
then renal function improved; most likely secondary to the
ACE inhibitor that had been titrated up in the context of the
patient having one kidney.  It was very possible she could
have renal vascular disease in that one kidney.  The Renal
team was following the patient.  It was also possible that
she had been taking a [**Doctor Last Name **]-2 inhibitor with the ACE inhibitor,
and this combination was bad for her renal function, and it
was eventually felt by the Renal team that this was the most
likely etiology of the patient's renal failure.  When the
patient was discharged, she was instructed to stay away from
[**Doctor Last Name **]-2 inhibitors, to not take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs, and to not take digitalis, and that she could start an
ACE inhibitor as an outpatient.  On the day of discharge, her
creatinine was 1.4 and her blood urea nitrogen was 35.

Addendum:  The patient was offered the colonoscopy as an
inpatient, but she had deferred it and told to be done as an
outpatient.

3.  CODE STATUS:  The patient was do not intubate during her
stay but was positive cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home
with services from Visiting Nurse Association who was to send
the patient's INR levels to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  They were also
to check daily weights.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, mitral
regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Acute renal failure.
4.  Anemia with guaiac-positive stools with an INR of 8.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient had
appointments made on [**2-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Heart
Failure Clinic; [**3-2**] at Adult Medicine Clinic with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]; and on [**3160-3-9**] with General Cardiology.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  She had no major surgical procedures.
She did have the echocardiogram (as stated earlier), and she
was on dialysis (as stated earlier).

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o. three times per day (with
meals).
2.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. once per day.
3.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. three times per day.
4.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. once per day.
6.  Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets as needed.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Abnormal screening mammogram.
     
     Comparison with the patient's prior mammogram at [**Hospital1 550**], [**Location (un) 7886**] on [**3160-10-31**]
     shows no suspicious masses or calcifications.  Heterogeneously dense breast
     tissue limits the sensitivity of mammography. The suspected faint
     calcifications posterior to the right nipple are not confirmed in additional
     magnification views obtained separately.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of malignancy.  BIRADS 1 - negative.
