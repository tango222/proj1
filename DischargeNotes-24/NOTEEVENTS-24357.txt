                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-nine year old male with coronary artery disease.  S/p coronary 
     artery bypass grafting in [**3119**] with known occlusion of the SVG-D1.  S/p stenting
     of native right coronary artery.  Referred for routine coronary artery disease
     evaluation.
      
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
      
     Exercise protocol:  [**Doctor First Name 362**].
     Exercise duration:  8 minutes.   
     Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained:  80%.
     Symptoms during exercise:  the patient reported mid sternal chest pressure 
     beginning at 6 minutes of exercise (7/10 intensity) which progressed to [**10-24**]
     intensity at 8 minutes.  The pain had some radiation to the back but was largely
     negated to the sternum.  The pain diminished upon cessation of exercise and was
     completely gone by 3 minutes of recovery.
     Reason exercise terminated:  fatigue and chest pain.
     ECG findings:  ECG showed downsloping ST depression in leads V5, V6, I and AVL
     beginning at 6 minutes, with a maximal depression of 2.[**Street Address 1821**] depression in
     lead V at 3 minutes of recovery.  The ST segments resolved by 15 minutes of
     recovery.  
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
      
     Imaging Protocol: gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.  
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     Exercise images were obtained with MIBI.
      
     The left ventricular cavity appears dilated with stress suggesting myocardial
     ischemia.
      
     The SPECT images demonstrate a severe distal anterior and severe apical
     reversible defects.  There is a severe inferior perfusion defect which is
     partially reversible.
       
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     exercise shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 40%. The
     wall motion is globally hypokinetic.  Contraction in the distal anterior,
     inferior and apical walls is not accurately evaluated due to the reduced counts
     in these areas.
      
     Comparison with the previous exercise thallium scan performed on [**3119-5-8**] has
     been made.  Allowing for the marked changes in technique, the findings are
     similar.
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) At the level of exercise achieved, there is a severe, reversible
     defect involving the distal anterior and apical walls and a severe partially
                                                                 (Over)

     reversible defect in the inferior left ventricular wall.  2) There is left
     ventricle dilation at stress, suggesting ischemia.  3) The wall motion
     demonstrates global hypokinesia with an ejection fraction of 40%.  4) Allowing
     for differences in technique, there is no significant difference from the
     previous exercise thallium scan performed in [**3119-4-16**]. /nkg

Admission Date:  [**3129-7-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**3129-7-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**3070-7-4**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year-old
male with a history of an inferior wall myocardial infarction
status post coronary artery bypass graft done in [**3119**] with a
left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior
descending coronary artery graft, saphenous vein graft to D2
graft, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal graft.  He was
doing fine until [**4-/3127**] when he began to have exertional
chest pain.  His catheterization on [**3127-5-5**] revealed
pathology in the mid right coronary artery, which was
stented.  He returned in [**3128-12-3**] for
catheterization, which again was due to exertional angina.
This catheterization showed significant three vessel disease
with a patent saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal two,
occluded saphenous vein graft to diagonal, patent left
internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery, patent stent to the mid right coronary
artery, proximal right coronary artery had a focal 80%
stenosis and the distal right coronary artery had a severe
focal 90% stenosis prior to the origin of the posterior
descending coronary artery, status post stent placement to
the proximal and distal right coronary artery.

The patient was doing well without any chest pain after this
most recent intervention in November of last year.  However,
he does report having shortness of breath with exertion and
minimal exercise.  The patient denies claudication,
orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
lightheadedness.  A recent stress test revealed that the
patient had a down sloping ST depression in V5 and V6, 1 and
L with maximum ST depressions of 2.5 mm in V5 at 3 minutes.
A nuclear study revealed severe reversible defect in the
distal anterior and apical walls and severe partially
reversible defect in the inferior left ventricular wall with
global hypokinesis and an EF of 40%.

The patient was electively taken to the catheterization
laboratory on [**7-25**] where he was found to have a total
occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary
artery, total occlusion of the proximal left circumflex, 60%
mid segment stenosis in the previously stented right coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to D1 continued to be occluded
as had been previously, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal one was mid segment 80% focal lesion.  The left
internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery was found to be patent with the left anterior
descending coronary artery after the touch down showed a
total occlusion.  The saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
one was stented, however, the inferior pole from the outflow
vessel of the obtuse marginal had moderate slow flow after
intervention and was recrossed with the BMW wire plus
dilation, which restored TIMI two flow.  The superior flow
from the out flow of the obtuse marginal was dilated and
restored TIMI three flow.

Upon entering the wards after the catheterization, the
patient underwent a ventricular fibrillation arrest within a
few hours of his procedure.  The patient responded to one
defibrillator shock, which returned a perfusing rhythm,
however, the patient was diaphoretic, short of breath with
chest pain after being revived.  Electrocardiogram showed ST
elevations in the anterolateral leads, which led to the
patient immediately being taken back to the catheterization
laboratory.  During the second PCI it was noted that the
recently placed stent was patent, but that the inferior pole
had TIMI two flow and the prior study was completely occluded
therefore the inferior pole lesion was crossed at the wires,
stented open and TIMI three flow was returned to the vessel.
The patient's symptoms resolved after the procedure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease,
hyperlipidemia, hypertension.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Atenolol 50 mg po q day,
Lipitor 80 mg q day, Univasc 15 mg b.i.d., Norvasc 10 mg
q.d., Ascriptin 325 mg q day, vitamin C 1000 mg q day, folic
acid 1 mg q day and multivitamin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.4, pulse 72.  Blood
pressure 121/62.  Respirations 14.  The patient was sating
97% on 2 liters.  Generally, he was alert and oriented times
three.  No acute distress.  Moderately obese male.  HEENT
examination pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  The patient was normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck examination
there is no JVP.  No thyromegaly.  No bruits.  No cervical
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate.  Normal S1 and normal S2 and a 2 out of 6
systolic decrescendo murmur best auscultated at the left
sternal border.  No rubs.  Pulmonary examination lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes.  Abdominal
examination soft, nontender, nondistended and bowel sounds
were active.  Extremities, the patient had 1+ dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally with 2+ capillary refill bilaterally.  The
patient's groin site was free of hematoma, however, the
sheaths were still in place on the right when he was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  A:  Coronary artery
disease, the patient has extensive coronary artery disease
based on his prior coronary artery bypass graft and most
recent angiography, which demonstrated three vessel disease
with restenosis to some extent of each of his bypass grafts.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was to discuss the possibility of a second
cardiothoracic surgery with the CT surgeons.  The patient was
given Integrilin for 18 hours and started on Plavix for a
thirty day course and given aspirin and Lipitor q day per his
outpatient regimen for hypercholesterolemia.  Folate was
continued throughout the hospitalization and the patient was
restarted on Univasc at 15 mg q day, which was half his
normal dose.  The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction
with CK levels of 529, CKMB 88, with an index of 16.6 on the
11th after the patient's defib arrest.  The patient's CKs
peaked at that level and had declined to a CPK of 396 with a
CKMB of 27 and an index of 6.8 on the [**7-27**].  These
enzymes elevations were thought to be a result of the
combination of the defibrillation shock and the occlusion of
the lower pole vessel, which was stented open in the
catheterization laboratory during the second percutaneous
intervention.

B:  Pump, the patient was initially started on Lopresor 25
b.i.d. after returning from the catheterization laboratory.
His heart rate, however, on hospital day number two was
elevated in the high 90s and in to the 100s as high as 118.
The patient was given intravenous Lopresor, which brought his
rate down to the 60s and 70s.  His Lopressor dose was
increased to 75 mg b.i.d., which is what he was discharged to
home on.  This regimen can be modified to optimize his heart
rate and blood pressure, however, at the time of discharge
the patient's blood pressure could not tolerate an increase
in this dose.  The patient's echocardiogram done on the [**7-26**] revealed a left ventricular cavity that was mildly
dilated with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and
overall left ventricular systolic function that was severely
depressed.  Additionally the aortic valve leaflets were found
to be mildly thickened.  Mitral valve leaflets were also
found to be mildly thickened and there was 1+ mild mitral
regurgitation.  The patient's ejection fraction had been
estimated to be 25 to 30%.  It was recommended by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 77**]
that a repeat stress echocardiogram be done in one month to
evaluate the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction in
light of the defibrillation and mild myocardial infarction
that the patient had suffered during his hospitalization.  It
would be expected that the patient's ejection fraction
increase.

C:  Rhythm, the patient experienced a V fibrillation arrest
after his first percutaneous intervention, which was likely
due to the thrombosis of the inferior pole vessel of the
obtuse marginal.  When the vessel was stented open the
patient was not thought to have any residual risk of
arrhythmia after the twelve hour reperfusion arrhythmia
window had closed.  The patient was kept on telemetry and
serial electrocardiograms were checked.  Frequent ectopy was
noted in the first 24 hours after the catheterization.
However, with electrolyte correction his ectopy diminished
and the patient's rhythm was relatively regular.  The patient
did have several hours of sinus tachycardia that was treated
with intravenous Lopressor as noted above.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient sated well throughout his
hospitalization initially on 2 liters of oxygen, which was
weaned to off on hospital day two.

3.  Renal:  The patient's BUN and creatinine remained within
normal limits despite the dye load of two catheterization
procedures.  The patient maintained good urine output
throughout the hospitalization.

4.  Hematology:  The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit
remained stable and within normal limits throughout the
hospitalization.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient has no history of diabetes and
his blood glucoses were in the high normal range throughout
his hospitalization.  It is recommended that the hemoglobin
A1C be checked on an outpatient basis to assess for
burgeoning diabetes picture.

6.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was given Docusate for
constipation and Protonix for peptic ulcer disease throughout
his hospitalization.

7.  Activity:  The patient was visited by the physical
therapist who evaluated the patient and helped arrange
outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.  The patient was able to
tolerate significant activities such as climbing stairs and
walking the hallways without symptoms.  The patient was
discharged to home in good condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction.
2.  Ventricular fibrillation.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Coronary artery disease.

     HISTORY:  CAD evaluation. 
      
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB: 
      
     Exercise protocol:  [**Doctor Last Name 1829**]. 
     Exercise duration:  10 minutes.    
     Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained:  73%. 
     Symptoms during exercise:  none. 
     Reason exercise terminated:  fatigue. 
     ECG findings:  paced rhythm. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  
      
     Imaging Protocol: gated SPECT. 
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.   
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     Exercise images were obtained with MIBI. 
      
     Stress and resting perfusion images demonstrate moderate ischemic defects  
     involving the distal anterior, apical, and inferolateral walls, with partial
     reversibility noted.   
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     exercise shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 29%. 
      
     The wall motion images demonstrate global hypokinesis. 
      
     Date of prior study:  [**3129-7-9**]. 
      
     There is interval development of a lateral wall ischemic defect when compared to
     the prior study. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) At the level of exercise achieved, there is a moderate,

     HISTORY:  Sixty year old male with known CAD (s/p CABG, RCA, PTCA and  
     pacer/AISD). 
      
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB: 
     Exercise protocol:  [**Doctor Last Name 1829**]. 
     Exercise duration:  12 minutes.    
     Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained:  72%. 
     Symptoms during exercise:  no anginal symptoms. 
     Reason exercise terminated:  fatigue. 
     ECG findings:  no ischemic ECG changes.  
      
     INTERPRETATION:  
     Imaging Protocol: gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     Exercise images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
      
     Stress images show marked left ventricular dilatation.  There are moderate
     defects involving the distal aspect of the anterior wall, apex and lateral wall.
        Resting perfusion images demonstrate partial reversibility involving all
     three defects.  There is a moderate fixed inferior wall defect  There is resting
     dilatation of the left ventricle, less marked than at stress. 
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     exercise is 30%.  There is diffuse hypokinesia, with paradoxical movement
     involving the distal anterior wall and apex. 
      
     There is a prior study dated [**3129-12-31**] as well as [**3129-7-9**].  There is no
     significant change from the December study. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  At the level of exercise achieved, there is a moderate, partially
     reversible defect involving the distal anterior wall, apex and lateral wall. 
     There is a moderate fixed inferior wall defect. There is marked left ventricular
     dilitation, more severe on stress imaging.  There is global hypokinesia with
     paradoxical movement of the anterior/apical wall.  The EF is 30%.
