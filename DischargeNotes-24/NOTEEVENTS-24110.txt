History of Present Illness:
HPI: 80 yo lady w/ h/o NHL dx'd 1998 tx w/ CHOP and rituximab, 
remote breast ca, and recent RUL resection ([**5-23**]) for spiculated 
lung mass (path c/w NHL recurrence), presents to ED w/ acute 
worsening sob over last 24 hrs and subacute worsening over last 
week. This is in the setting of stopping her daily lasix because 
""I feel sick when I am on it.""  There was some confusion on her 
part about whether to take her potassium, lasix, or both, as she 
was seen in ED last week for hypokalemia and has not been sure 
what to take since that visit. At that time, she was given K 
repletion and sent home. She has been taking lasix 
intermittently since last week, last dose today. Patient denies 
fevers/chills/malaise/abd complaints. She sleeps in seated 
position secondary to ""inner [**Last Name **] problem,"" but denies orthopnea. 
She denies pedal edema or weight gain. Appetite has been good, 
per her report. She was discharged with home oxygen in July, but 
has not been using it until this past week. Cannot quantify how 
far she can walk w/o fatigue. Denies palpitations, chest 
discomfort. Of note, patient notes hoarse voice since her 
extubation from her RUL resection.
.
On presentation, T 95.9, BP 160/100; HR 100; sat 83% RA. NRB 
placed with sats to 100%.  Foley inserted, Lasix 20 mg IV given

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING: 
[**3015-8-6**]
BILATERAL DECUBITUS VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The pleural effusions 
appear to be layering, with the right larger than left. 
Underlying infiltrates, particularly in the right are also 
possible. Followup is recommended.
.
[**3015-8-7**]
CHEST X-RAY AP PORTABLE VIEW.
COMPARISON: Decubitus film of [**3015-8-6**].
FINDINGS: There is a moderate-to-severe right-sided pleural 
effusion and a small left pleural effusion. The heart size is 
normal. There is no other interval change.
IMPRESSION: A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small 
left pleural effusion
.
[**3015-8-8**]
Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**3015-8-7**].
FINDINGS: Heart is partially obscured, but unchanged and likely 
of normal size. There are bilateral pleural effusions, large on 
the right and moderate on the left, unchanged. No pneumothorax 
identified. Bibasilar atelectasis persists.
IMPRESSION: No change from previous exam
.
[**3015-8-9**]
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-8**]:
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the right and 
moderate on the left, has increased in volume. There is new 
atelectasis or conceivably consolidation in the lateral aspect 
of the right mid lung, which should be reassessed following 
decrease in pleural fluid. Mediastinum remains shifted slightly 
to the right. Heart size is obscured by pleural effusion, but 
has not changed in the interim. There is no pneumothorax.
.
[**3015-8-11**]
History of right upper lobectomy and shortness of breath.

There is loss of volume on the right with elevation of the right 
hemidiaphragm and shift of heart and mediastinum to the right. 
There are bilateral pleural effusions. The ill-defined right mid 
zone opacity noted on the prior film of [**3015-8-9**], has 
partially resolved. There is persistent ill-defined opacity at 
the right lung base. In addition, there is ill-defined opacity 
in the left lower zone that is either new or was partly hidden 
by the left pleural effusion on the prior film. No definite 
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar pulmonary 
opacities consistent with atelectases/consolidation. No 
pneumothorax. Partial resolution of the right mid zone opacity.
.
[**3015-8-12**]
LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS CHEST: A small pleural effusion is seen, 
loculated, on the right. Right lateral decubitus films show no 
evidence of nondependent air, i.e., no findings to suggest 
pneumothorax. Otherwise, findings are not significantly changed 
since the examination of 12:15 of the same day.
.
EKG: sinus vs sinus arrythmia, tachy, rate 104; nl axis; no LVH, 
nl qwaves or ischemic changes
.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80 yo lady w/ remote br ca, NHL w/ lung recurrence and s/p 
RUL lobectomy, here w/ shortness of breath; re-accumulation of 
pleural effusions.
.
1. dyspnea: likely [**12-21**] growing effusions in setting of erratic 
lasix dosing. Likely transudative on last admission's tap, but 
full chemistries not sent, so it remains unclear. Has good EF 
but MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], which likely contribute to her fluid overload. 
Patient was afebrile during the admission and did not need to be 
on antibiotics. Cytology negative on previous tap. Breathing 
markedly improved after IV diuresis and continued on PO diuresis 
post ICU. The pleural effusions were serially monitored on CXR. 
On HOD#6, patient had bilateral thoracenteses of her pleural 
effusions (after reducing her INR with 5mg vit K). FLuid 
analysis (LDH ration 0.6) was interpreted as borderline 
exudative effusions. Patient had a questionable pneumothorax - 
very small in RLL. She was monitored overnight and was not in 
any respiratory distress. On HOD#7, she was comfortable on room 
air and breath. Repeat CXR could not rule out a loculated 
pneumothorax - hence a lateral decubitus film was sent which 
showed:A small pleural effusion is seen, loculated, on the 
right. Right lateral decubitus films show no evidence of 
nondependent air, i.e., no findings to suggest pneumothorax. 
Otherwise, findings are not significantly changed since the 
examination of 12:15 of the same day.
.
2. NHL: known recurrence in right lung. Followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2267**]. 
Candidate for more CHOP?. Performance status [**12-22**] so may need 
more rehab before this is possible. Last rec'd chop several 
years ago (w/ rituximab). Patient's WBC count began to rise in 
July from 7->14. And on D/c, wbc count was also rising from 
13.9->17->19->23. 
.
3. AF: on coumadin, dilt, amiodarone as outpatient. These meds 
were continued. currently back in sinus arrythmia with stable BP 
 alternates between afib and sinus arrhythmia. INR was reversed 
for thoracentesis; restarted on coumadin 2.5mg qhs afterwards. 
Also on Dilt 90mg po qid and continued amiodarone 200qd 
.
4. Voice hoarseness: due to past ET tube placement during the 
surgery in [**3015-5-19**].  Consider ENT appt as outpt to eval
.
4. HTN: continue lisinopril 10 qd. Patient also was being 
diuresed. BP well controlled throughout hospitalization.
.
5. BPV: on meclizine at home. Kept her on low dose here. 
.
6. FEN: replete K, Mg now. Watch lytes in setting of diuresis. 
Heart healthy/ low sodium diet. Careful I/O and daily weights. 
Check albumin.
.
7. communication: patient; brother is next of [**Doctor First Name **]: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4646**] 
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1815**]; Mark is her nephew in [**Name2 (NI) 439**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4647**]
.
8. code: full, discussed with patient. Patient kept insisting 
that she could not bear to be hoarse again, but I believe she 
still intends to be intubated, if necessary
.
9. access: peripheral IV's
.
10. ppx: heparin sc until INR >2. Protonix; encourage ambulation 
as she is able. Will get PT to see patient.
.
dispo: likely to floor soon, tele bed.; consider thoracentesis 
as above; may need placement or more home services. Social work 
consult to help with this as well, since the patient's ability 
to live at home may be limited.  She lives with 84 year old 
brother who [**Name2 (NI) 4648**] is sick.  Patient was c/o'ed to the floor to 
the East Wards teams

     HISTORY:  Right upper lobe lobectomy, status post thoracentesis, acute
     shortness of breath.
     
     CHEST, ONE VIEW:  Comparison with [**3015-7-13**].  There are moderate
     bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  The cardiac contour
     cannot be evaluated.  There is atelectasis in the right mid lung zone and
     volume loss of the right lung.
     No definite pneumothorax is visualized.  There appears to be an ill-defined
     opacity in the right paratracheal region, but this is difficult to evaluate
     due to the underlying effusion.  Followup is recommended.

     There is loss of volume on the right with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
     and shift of heart and mediastinum to the right.  There are bilateral pleural
     effusions.  The ill-defined right mid zone opacity noted on the prior film of

     opacity at the right lung base.  In addition, there is ill-defined opacity in

     pleural effusion on the prior film.  No definite pneumothorax.

     History of right upper lobectomy with acute shortness of breath and bilateral
     thoracentesis.
     
     Since the prior film of [**3015-8-11**], there has been a significant
     reduction in the size of the right pleural effusion.  A curvilinear density
     overlies the right lower hemithorax, probably not a localized pneumothorax,
     but suggest reevaluate  on followup study.  There is atelectasis at the right
     base.  There is persistent ill-defined opacity at the left lung base. The
     previously noted small right upper lobe opacity has resolved.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent left lower lobe opacity, unchanged.  Suggest followup
     film to evaluate curvilinear density in right lower zone and rule out
     localized pneumothorax as described.

     SINGLE UPRIGHT CHEST:  Comparison with [**3015-8-11**], 5:30 p.m. film.
     
     Again seen is the linear opacity along the right lateral thorax, which may
     represent a summation of shadows versus a localized pneumothorax.
     Additionally, there is continued airspace consolidation in both lower lung
     zones and accumulation of a small pleural effusion on the right. Cardiac,

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lymphoma.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso dated [**3015-4-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained after the administration of IV and oral contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is status post interval right
     upper lobectomy.  There is interval development of bilateral pleural
     effusions, right greater than left.  The patient is status post left
     mastectomy.  There is a stable left lower lobe nodule (series 2 image 25).
     Note is made of a markedly dilated esophagus with reflux of oral contrast to
     the subcarinal level.  No new pulmonary nodules are identified.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a stable linear hypoenhancing
     area in segment IV of the liver.  Atrophic left lateral segment of the liver
     is unchanged.  Gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen are unremarkable.  There is a
     stable subcentimeter low-attenuation lesion in the lower pole of the right
     kidney that is too small to characterize.  No hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
     There are multiple stable scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest
     measuring 11 mm in the left paraaortic region.  Small and large bowels are of
     normal caliber with no wall thickening.  No free air in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The bladder, rectum, and sigmoid colon are
     unremarkable.  No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate scoliosis and degenerative changes with no suspicious
     lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Status post interval right upper lobectomy with interval development of
     bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
     2.  Stable left lower lobe nodule.
     3.  Interval development of markedly dilated esophagus with reflux of
     contrast.  If cinically indicated, this may be further evaluated with a formal
     barium swallow exam.
     4.  Stable linear low-density lesion in the liver.
     5.  Stable retroperitoneal lymph nodes, most prominent in the left paraaortic
     region.
                                                                 (Over)

               80 year old woman s/p RUL lobectomy [**5-22**]  
                 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      follow up right thoracotomy
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
     
     INDICATION:  Status post right upper lobectomy in [**3015-5-19**].  Followup right
     thoracotomy.
     
     FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest examination is analyzed in direct comparison
     with a similar study dated [**3015-9-14**].  Status post right upper
     lobectomy is noted with apparent resection of the fifth rib on the right side.
     There is a moderate volume loss in the right-sided hemithorax with mild
     mediastinal shift towards the operated side and slight elevation of the
     diaphragm.  Also the aerated remaining lung is surrounded by pleural scar
     formations.  On the left side no pulmonary congestion is identified and no
     acute parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  The low-positioned diaphragm and the
     _____ favor the diagnosis of COPD which apparently the patient had already
     prior to the operation for a pulmonary carcinoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings since [**3015-9-14**], findings compatible
     with status post right-sided upper lobectomy.  No new masses identified.

     INDICATION:  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3015-10-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices through the
     symphysis pubis after the administration of nonionic Optiray contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is status post right upper
     lobectomy with a small right-sided pleural effusion.  The pleural effusion has
     decreased in size when compared to the previous exam.  Scarring is seen within
     the left lung apex.  The patient is status post left mastectomy.  There is a
     tiny nodule within the left lower lobe, which is stable when compared to the
     previous exam.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no evidence of
     abnormal axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Dilatation of the
     esophagus is again identified.  There are scattered aortic wall
     calcifications.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There are multiple
     nonpathologically enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal paraaortic nodes,
     stable when compared to the previous exam.  There are dense aortic and iliac
     wall calcifications.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are small inguinal nodes
     bilaterally.  No pathologic lymphadenopathy is identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is a rotary scoliosis with degenerative changes within
     the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pathologic lymphadenopathy within the chest, abdomen or
     pelvis.
     2.  Stable scarring within the left lung apex and post-right upper lobe
     lobectomy.  Interval decrease in size of right-sided pleural effusion.  Stable
     left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with h/o lung cancer s/p right upper lobectomy [**5-22**]
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      follow up lung cancer. Please compare to prior studies.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after right upper lobectomy
     due to lung cancer.
     
     PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to the previous film from
     [**3015-12-7**].
     
     The post-right upper lobectomy changes are again demonstrated, stable.  There
     is moderate volume loss of the right-sided hemithorax with mild ipsilateral
     mediastinal shift and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There are no
     consolidations or masses on the right.  The right lung is unremarkable
     demonstrating again the vascular poucity and architectural distortion,
     representing known emphysema. Calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe with
     volume loss and upward displacement of the left hila are also chronic.  There
     is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
     
     The patient is after left mastectomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Stable appearance of the post-surgical chest.
     
     Status post left mastectomy.
     
     Upward displacement of the left hilar due to most probably post granulomatous
     exposure changes.
