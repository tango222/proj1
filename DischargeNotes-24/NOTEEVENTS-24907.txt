Admission Date:  [**2972-10-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2972-11-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2893-2-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
woman transferred from [**Hospital 2811**] Hospital after her daughter
found her to be confused.  Normally, she is very sharp
according to the daughter.  She lives alone.  She did not
remember family members or friends.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Cataracts.
3.  Osteoporosis.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.6, blood pressure 158/77, heart rate 61, respiratory rate
16, saturation 100%.  General:  The patient was wide awake,
oriented to herself only.  HEENT:  The pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light, 3 down to 2 mm.  EOMs were
full.  She was following commands.  Lungs:  Clear
bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen: Soft, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.  Neurologic:
She was wide awake and disoriented.  Negative drift.
Symmetric smile.  Speech fluent.  Only following one-step
commands inconsistently.  Grasp 4+ on the right, 5 on the
left.  IP [**5-25**] bilaterally.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  A head CT showed a left frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU for
close neurologic evaluation.  She had an MRI with and without
gadolinium but again just showed the large left frontal
bleed.  The patient was transferred to the regular floor on
hospital day number two where she has remained neurologically
stable.  She is awake, alert, and oriented times one.  She
was moving all extremities with good strength, no weakness.
She will be evaluated by physical therapy and occupational
therapy and most likely will need [**Hospital 1062**] rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Decadron 2 mg p.o. q. 12 to be weaned off over two days.
2.  Senna one tablet p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
3.  Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. 24 hours.  The patient did
have a UTI on admission.
6.  Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours.
7.  Tylenol 650 p.o. q. four p.r.n.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Valsartan 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable at the time of discharge.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5**] with a
repeat head CT in one month.  Will repeat MRI scan in one
month.

      79 year old woman with one day mental status changes, head CT from OSH with 
      left frontal intra-parenchymal bleed with some edema
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate for source of intra-parenchymal bleed, evaluate for mass/tumor with 
      and without gadolinium
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Intraparenchymal bleed seen on outside head CT. Question
     intraparenchymal mass lesion.
     
     It should be noted that MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 309**] was also performed.
     
     Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images of the brain were obtained. Diffusion
     images and post gadolinium administration T1 axial and coronal images were
     performed. 3D time of flight MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 309**] was obtained. The MRA
     exam was degraded by motion artifact.
     
     There are no acute territorial infarcts seen on perfusion images. A cavitary
     mass lesion is seen involving the left frontal lobe measuring 4.3 x 2.5 cm and
     demonstrates a fluid level. There is magnetic susceptibility seen within the
     lesion due to the presence of byproducts of blood due to its hemorrhagic
     nature. There is surrounding T2 hyperintensity suggestive of edema and the
     mass effect over the superior aspect of the left lateral ventricle. There is
     minimal enhancement surrounding the lesion following gadolinium
     administration. No other enhancing lesions could be demonstrated within the
     brain.  There are other scattered foci of T2 hyperintensity in the
     periventricular white matter suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic
     changes. Correlation with outside CT exam would be helpful for further
     evaluation. There is a small less than 1 cm round enhancing structure probably
     along the inner table of the skull which is nonspecific and could represent a
     large vascular [**Doctor Last Name **].
     
     MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 309**] was significantly degraded by motion artifact.
     There is mild stenosis of the right distal vertebral artery. The visualized
     intracranial circulation is patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Large cavitary mass lesion demonstrating a fluid level with byproducts of
     blood involving the left frontal lobe and minimally enhancing following
     gadolinium.  The presence of mass effect along the superior aspects of the
     left lateral ventricle and surrounding T2 hyperintensity is suggestive of a
     hemorrhagic mass lesion which would be either a primary neoplasm or metastatic
     in nature.  An intraparenchymal hematoma related to coagulopathy or amyloid
     angiopathy is a less likely consideration.  Follow up MRI of the brain with
     gadolinium administration along with neurosurgical consultation would be
                                                                 (Over)
