Admission Date: [**3098-5-8**]
Discharge Date: [**3098-5-19**]
Date of Birth:  [**3020-3-9**]
Sex:  M
Service:  VSU


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Neck mass.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Death.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old male with an
enlarging neck mass.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 78-year-old male with a 6-
week history of a sore throat, dysphagia and difficulty
breathing who appeared to have a thyroid mass on exam by his
physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] underwent a CT scan with fine needle aspiration
which was indeterminate in an outside hospital and he was
seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who felt that based on the
symptoms of his thyroid mass that it may be a thyroid cancer.
He was therefore booked for an operative thyroidectomy. The
patient was admitted to the hospital on [**3-8**] of 2006 for
thyroidectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is significant
for peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, CREST
syndrome, scleroderma, CAD with CHF, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, iron deficiency anemia, gout, chronic renal
failure, deep venous thrombosis, asbestosis, hypertension,
hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history is significant
for bilateral femoral to dorsal pedal bypass grafts with
saphenous vein for treatment of bilateral thrombosed
popliteal aneurysms.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Synthroid, Lopressor,
Protonix, Lasix, insulin.

ALLERGIES:  An allergy to Coumadin as well as a questionable
allergy to heparin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married with 6 children, a retired
electrician, 1 pack per day smoking history for 4 years. He
quit 45 years ago. He rarely drank alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for occasional shortness of
[**Last Name (LF) 680**], [**First Name3 (LF) 348**] on exertion, otherwise unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the surgical
service and on [**5-10**], underwent a neck exploration with
biopsy of the central portion of the thyroid and tracheostomy
for an obstructing goiter. That was subsequently revealed to
be lymphoma. On the 31st, he underwent a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy for nutrition. He was seen by
hematology/oncology on [**5-12**] for treatment of his B-cell
lymphoma and he was transferred to the hematology/oncology
service for that. On [**5-17**], however, he underwent a CT scan
for abdominal pain and was found to have a ruptured
retroperitoneal aortic aneurysm. He was emergently taken to
the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 943**] and he underwent a repair
of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Postoperatively, he was noted
to have pale bilateral lower extremities. By postoperative
day #1, these were beginning to demarcate at the mid thigh.
At this time, he was intubated in the intensive care unit. He
was taken back to the operating room for bilateral femoral
embolectomies because of progressive ischemia of his
bilateral lower extremities. This happened on [**5-18**].
Postoperatively, however, he had persistent ischemia of both
lower extremities. By [**5-19**], he was respirator-dependent
with rising creatinine kinase. His extremities were
completely demarcated at the mid thigh and given his degree
of progressive renal failure/anuria, hypotension requiring
pressors, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support
and peripheral vascular disease with ischemia of both lower
extremities that was going to require bilateral lower
extremity amputations, his family deemed that they did not
want to pursue any further aggressive treatment options and
the patient was made comfort measures only. The patient
expired on [**5-19**] at 6:50 p.m.

      78 year old man with 5 week history of dysphagia, found to have large thryroid

                                     FINAL REPORT
     History: Enlarging thyroid mass.
     
     Neck MR performed with T1 and T2 wieghted images, followed by T1 post
     contrast. No prior neck MR available for comparison. The images are degraded
     by motion artifact and are of limited diagnostic usefulness.
     
     Fidings: There is a large mass arising from the right thyroid gland. This
     causes leftward displacement of the trachea, and infiltrates posterior and
     anterior to the trachea. There appears to be an intact ring of cartilege
     separating the bulk of the mass from the trachea. I cannot separate the mass
     from the esophagus, nor can I exclude posterior invasion into the trachea via
     the cartilage defect posteriorly.
     
     There is lateral displacement of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein,
     both of which appear patent. At its greatest extent, the mass appears to
     surround the carotid artery greater than 270 degrees. In the setting of
     malignant squamous cell tumors, this would imply encasement. its significance
     in thyroid tumors is unknown. the mass extends inferiorly just below the top
     of the manubrium.
     
     There is a mass lateral to the carotid and jugular that most likely represents
     adenopathy, but may be contiguous spread from the dominant mass. The mass has
     inhomogeneous intensity and may contain several areas of necrosis. There is
     inhomogenenous intensity within the slightly enlarged left thyroid lobe.
     
     There is a single enlarge left level 3 node.
     
     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 69**] on 5.29/06.
     
     Conclusion: Large right thyroid mass with displacement but no definite
     invasion of the trachea, although the study is of limited quality due to
     motion artifact.
     
     Possible right neck node vs direct extension. single left neck node.
     Possible encasement of the right carotid artery.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Large B-cell lymphoma of the neck.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  After administration of oral contrast, MDCT was used to obtain
     contiguous axial images of the liver, followed by IV contrast-enhanced images
     through the chest, abdomen and pelvis and 3-minute delayed images through the
     kidneys.  No prior CT available for comparison.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  As identified on previous studies, there is a
     large mass centered in the right thyroid bed, causing mass effect on the
     trachea.  A tracheostomy tube is seen.  Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph
     nodes are identified, for example, subcarinal node measuring 10 mm, another
     paratracheal node measuring 11 mm.  There is a 9-mm lymph node seen anterior
     to the aortic root.  A subcarinal node measuring 12 x 20 mm is seen.  No
     axillary lymphadenopathy is identified. There is no hilar lymphadenopathy.
     There are coronary vascular calcifications.  Calcified pleural plaques are
     seen in the right hemithorax inferior aspect.  There is a 6 mm ill-defined
     pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.  A second one is seen measuring 6
     mm, also in the right upper lobe.  There is dependent atelectasis in both lung
     bases.
     
     CT ABDOMEN BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of free air
     within the abdomen.  A small amount of air is seen outlining the porta
     hepatis, in the right renal fossa, and also air between the peritoneum and the
     left rectus muscle and in subcutaneous tissues, consistent with the patient's
     history of recent surgically placed gastrostomy tube.  The liver is homogenous
     in density.  Layering material within the gallbladder may represent layering
     sludge versus vicarious excretion of contrast.  Low-density lesions in the
     kidney are too small to fully characterize; the largest is in the upper pole,
     measuring 7 mm.  The left kidney is atrophic.  Pancreas, spleen, stomach, and
     bowel loops are unremarkable.  There are small lymph nodes in the
     retroperitoneum, for example, 9 mm aortocaval node is seen.  There is
     aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta measuring 50 x 52 mm in greatest
     axial diameter.  The wall is calcified, and there is a small-moderate mural
     hematoma. No evidence of dissection is seen.  A PEG is seen in the fundus of
     the stomach.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A small amount of nondependent air is seen in the
     bladder, likely iatrogenic.  There are sigmoid diverticula without evidence of
     diverticulitis.  Calcifications within the common iliac artery and external
                                                                 (Over)

     seen in the pelvis.  Bilateral fat-containing small inguinal hernias are
     identified.  A surgical defect around the umbilicus in the abdominal wall is
     identified.
     
     There are degenerative changes of the spine.  No suspicious sclerotic or lytic
     lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Large mass centered in the right thyroid lobe The mass is inseperable from
     the posterior wall of the trachea and from the esophagus which is
     compressed in the proximal portion. Tumor infiltration cannot be excluded.
     2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy
     3. Small pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe. The significance of this
     finding is unclear and while these may represent granulomas, metastatic
     disease cannot be excluded.
     4. No evidence of intra- abdominal disease.
     5.  Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 52 mm in greatest axial
     dimension (transverse).
     6.  Large amount of intra-abdominal free air, probably due to patient's recent
     gastrostomy tube placement.
     7.  Low-density lesions in kidney, too small to fully characterize.
     8.  Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

     INDICATION:  Large B-cell lymphoma of the neck.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  After administration of oral contrast, MDCT was used to obtain
     contiguous axial images of the liver, followed by IV contrast-enhanced images
     through the chest, abdomen and pelvis and 3-minute delayed images through the
     kidneys.  No prior CT available for comparison.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  As identified on previous studies, there is a
     large mass centered in the right thyroid bed, causing mass effect on the
     trachea.  A tracheostomy tube is seen.  Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph
     nodes are identified, for example, subcarinal node measuring 10 mm, another
     paratracheal node measuring 11 mm.  There is a 9-mm lymph node seen anterior
     to the aortic root.  A subcarinal node measuring 12 x 20 mm is seen.  No
     axillary lymphadenopathy is identified. There is no hilar lymphadenopathy.
     There are coronary vascular calcifications.  Calcified pleural plaques are
     seen in the right hemithorax inferior aspect.  There is a 6 mm ill-defined
     pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.  A second one is seen measuring 6
     mm, also in the right upper lobe.  There is dependent atelectasis in both lung
     bases.
     
     CT ABDOMEN BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of free air
     within the abdomen.  A small amount of air is seen outlining the porta
     hepatis, in the right renal fossa, and also air between the peritoneum and the
     left rectus muscle and in subcutaneous tissues, consistent with the patient's

     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the neck were obtained with IV contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  Patient is status post tracheostomy.  There is some evidence of
     postoperative edema and subcutaneous gas consistent with recent procedure.
     Again noted is a large mass arising from the right thyroid gland causing
     leftward displacement of the trachea, infiltrating posteriorly and anterior to
     the trachea.  Compared to prior study, the left lobe of the thyroid appears
     larger.  The posterior aspect of the mass also appears larger.  Again seen is

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Thyroid mass found at the lymphoma, status post tracheostomy and
     PEG, status post chemotherapy.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT chest dated [**3098-5-12**] and CT neck performed the same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scan of the chest was performed following
     intravenous administration of 75 cc of Optiray contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is again demonstrated a large soft tissue density mass in the
     lower neck/superior mediastinum centered in the right lobe of the thyroid.
     Allowing for differences in slice selection, this mass is not significantly
     changed in size or configuration.  There is again demonstrated associated
     encasement of the adjacent trachea and esophagus with obliteration of the
     expected fat planes.  Focal narrowing of the adjacent esophagus and narrowing
     posteriorly of the trachea at the level of the mass makes it unclear whether
     there is associated invasion of these structures.  Multiple enlarged
     mediastinal nodes and paratracheal nodes are again demonstrated which are not
     significantly changed in size.  For instance, a subcarinal node now measures
     22 x 13 mm compared to 20 x 12 mm on the prior study.  The right hilum appears
     slightly more full than the prior study, though this may be due to differences
     in slice selection.  The lung demonstrates heterogeneous areas of attenuation
     with areas of air trapping on this relatively expiratory scan.  The previously
     identified right upper lobe nodular density is not seen on the current study,
     likely due to differences in technique and expiratory phase of scanning.  Note
     is also made of development of areas of septal thickening which could relate
     to superimposed fluid overload in addition to areas of air trapping.  There is
     no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are
     noted which could be consistent with a history of prior asbestos exposure.
     Coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the mitral annulus are
     noted.  The patient is status post tracheostomy tube and PEG tube placement.
     No new masses are identified.  The visualized portions of the upper abdomen
     again demonstrate a large amount of free intraperitoneal air, presumably
     secondary to PEG tube insertion.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     right thyroid, consistent with the patient's history of lymphoma.  There is at
     least severe encasement of the adjacent trachea and esophagus with
     obliteration of fat planes, and invasion of these structures cannot be
     excluded. Direct visual inspection could help clarify this issue.
     2.  Heterogeneous lung attenuation due to areas of air trapping on expiratory
     scan.  The prior right upper lobe nodule is not well seen likely due to

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old man with CREST, PVD, with thyroid mass found to be lymphoma, s/p 
      trach/PEG, s/p chemo with diminished size of mass-- ?possible resection
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please eval extension into chest, RUL nodules                                   
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Thyroid mass found at the lymphoma, status post tracheostomy and
     PEG, status post chemotherapy.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT chest dated [**3098-5-12**] and CT neck performed the same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scan of the chest was performed following
     intravenous administration of 75 cc of Optiray contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is again demonstrated a large soft tissue density mass in the
     lower neck/superior mediastinum centered in the right lobe of the thyroid.
     Allowing for differences in slice selection, this mass is not significantly
     changed in size or configuration.  There is again demonstrated associated
     encasement of the adjacent trachea and esophagus with obliteration of the
     expected fat planes.  Focal narrowing of the adjacent esophagus and narrowing
     posteriorly of the trachea at the level of the mass makes it unclear whether
     there is associated invasion of these structures.  Multiple enlarged
     mediastinal nodes and paratracheal nodes are again demonstrated which are not
     significantly changed in size.  For instance, a subcarinal node now measures
     22 x 13 mm compared to 20 x 12 mm on the prior study.  The right hilum appears
     slightly more full than the prior study, though this may be due to differences
     in slice selection.  The lung demonstrates heterogeneous areas of attenuation
     with areas of air trapping on this relatively expiratory scan.  The previously
     identified right upper lobe nodular density is not seen on the current study,
     likely due to differences in technique and expiratory phase of scanning.  Note
     is also made of development of areas of septal thickening which could relate
     to superimposed fluid overload in addition to areas of air trapping.  There is
     no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are
     noted which could be consistent with a history of prior asbestos exposure.
     Coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the mitral annulus are
     noted.  The patient is status post tracheostomy tube and PEG tube placement.
     No new masses are identified.  The visualized portions of the upper abdomen
     again demonstrate a large amount of free intraperitoneal air, presumably
     secondary to PEG tube insertion.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No short-term interval change since [**3098-5-12**] in large mass centered in the
                                                                 (Over)

     right thyroid, consistent with the patient's history of lymphoma.  There is at
     least severe encasement of the adjacent trachea and esophagus with
     obliteration of fat planes, and invasion of these structures cannot be
     excluded. Direct visual inspection could help clarify this issue.
     2.  Heterogeneous lung attenuation due to areas of air trapping on expiratory
     scan.  The prior right upper lobe nodule is not well seen likely due to
     technical factors.
     3.  No significant interval change in mediastinal adenopathy.

     INDICATION:  Lymphoma, new left lower quadrant pain.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A CT enterography protocol was used.  Axial MDCT images were
     obtained from the lung bases through the symphysis pubis after administration
     of non-ionic Optiray contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a small, left-sided pleural
     effusion.  There are pleural calcifications along the right lung base and
     diaphragm.  Free air is identified within the abdomen, likely related to
     recent percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.  Subcutaneous emphysema is
     also identified within the left anterior chest wall.  There is a large
     retroperitoneal hematoma which extends from the level of the diaphragm down to
     the left lower quadrant.  This is seen adjacent to the abdominal aortic
     aneurysm and is consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm leak/rupture.
     When comparing the abdominal aorta to the previous CT from [**3098-5-12**], the
     retroperitoneal hematoma is new and the size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm
     has increased from 5.2 to 6.0 cm.  The abdominal aorta also shows a slightly
     different shape compatible with interval change.  There appears to be
     interruption of the calcium within the abdominal aortic aneurysm suggesting
     the hemorrhage originates from the abdominal aorta.  The abdominal aortic
     aneursym is completely infrarenal in extension.  No active extravasation of
     contrast is identified on this single phase. The left kidney is atrophic.  The
     liver, right kidney, and spleen are unremarkable.  Mesenteric atherosclerotic
     calcifications are identified.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Small, fat-containing inguinal hernias are
     seen bilaterally.  There is extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid and
     descending colon without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Large, left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma which is associated with a
     large abdominal aortic aneurysm.  There is apparent disruption of the
     calcifications within the wall of the aneurysm which has changed in appearance
     in the short interval, compatible with abdominal aortic aneurysm leak/rupture.
     2) Free intraperitoneal air, likely related to recent percutaneous gastrostomy

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Laryngeal tumor.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Video oropharyngeal swallow examination.   
     
     An oropharyngeal swallowing video fluoroscopy study was performed in
     collaboration with the speech and language pathology division.  Thin liquid
     and nectar thick liquid were administered.
     
     FINDINGS:  Swallow initiation was timely but adequate palatal elevation.
     Laryngeal elevation was moderately reduced with relative no anterior movement.
     The laryngeal valve closure was mild to moderately reduced with absence of
     epiglottic deflection.  These findings were thought to be due to pharyngeal
     prominence due to tumor at the level of C4 to C6.  There was a moderate amount
     of residue in the piriform sinuses after thin and nectar liquids.  The patient
     had penetration during the swallow due to decreased laryngeal valve closure
     with thin and nectar-thick liquids.  The patient did not aspirate during the
     swallow.  However, he was unable to clear the penetration and did aspirate
     trace to mild amounts of nectar-thick liquids after the swallow.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Tumor at C4 to C6 causing reduced epiglottic deflection and
     absence of laryngeal valve closure.  There was residue in the piriform
     sinuses, more than in the valleculae.  There was aspiration with the first sip
     of thick liquids with the head in normal position.
     
     For further details, please refer to the full report of the speech and swallow
     evaluation team on CareWeb under patient's note section.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  78-year-old man with bilateral superficial femoral
     artery to  dorsal pedis bypass graft, now present with cold melting of both
     legs, needs ultrasound evaluation for graft patency.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the bilateral lower
     extremity.
     
     No blood flow signal was identified in the bilateral superficial femoral
     artery to dorsal pedis bypass grafts, which sugests graft occlusion. The left
     superficial femoral and deep femoral arteries, proximal to the graft, are
     patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Occluded bilateral superficial femoral to dorsal pedis bypass
     grafts.
     Results were communicated over the phone to the resident taking care of the

 Patient remained in afib all day with rate climbing up to 120's at times at which point SBP would drop into the low 80's. Otherwise BP remained 90-100 with MAP>60. Nicardipine gtt was turned off at 8am. CVP 11-12 and after 1u PRBC went up to 14 (HCT stable at 26), and PA numbers elevated (still unable to wedge). But still continued to make 10-20cc/hr of urine. ARF worsening with Creat increasing from 1.6 to 2.2 by afternoon with bump in BUN and K rising from 5.1 up to 5.9.
 Vascular team/attending notified by night RN on am rounds of absent BLE extremeties and cool/dusky CSM. When ppf turned off pt able to move legs slightly on bed but became aggitated so ppf restarted. BLE CSM worsened throughout the day with LLE becoming more mottled then RLE. Vascular team notified again and came to bedside to assess. Heparin gtt was started, NIVS done quickly and pt was brought to OR at 1630. 
 Family (children/wife) in and out all day and consented to OR. 
 Patient kept lightly sedated and comfortable on ppf/fent gtts. Denied any discomfort by nodding head and followed commands/moved extremeties on command.
 No vent changes were made all day abg's acceptable on AC 650/14 PEEP 5 FIO2 60%. Trach had an occassional leak which resolved with putting more air in balloon. Pt had some pluggy secretions in am but no further significant secretions.
