Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 536**] 
Chief Complaint:
Sharp neck pain with ""electric"" radiation into arms, right arm 
weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
71 yo female with a history of breast cancer, osteoarthritis and 

osteoporosis who presents with 2 weeks of neck and arm pain. 
She says that the pain began suddently two and a half weeks 
prior to admission. The pain was [**11-13**], located in her cervical 
spine and had an electric 
quality. Several days later, the pain began to spread to both 
arms (right worse than left) and she occasionally felt a burning 

sensation in her arms.  She went to her PMD and had and an 
X-ray, CT and MRI (w/o T1, T2 enhancement) of her cervical spine 
demonstrating degenerative changes at C5-6 with mild narrowing 
of the left neural foramen.  1 week prior to presentation she 
noted decreased strength in her right arm. She says that it is 
too weak to lift. According to the patient, her limited strength 
is due to actual weakness rather than pain. Her pain has 
continued and seems to 
be worse in the early morning and night-time. Overall, her 
symptoms seem to be increasing. She has tried multiple pain 
medications including Vioxx, Neurontin, Valium and Roxicet 
without significant relief.  She went to see a neurologist, Dr 
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-2**].  He performed an MRI (T1, T2, STIR) of the 
brachial plexus demonstrating ""Right apical soft tissue 
extending into the chest wall and adjacent to the brachial 
plexus at several locations with indistinctness of the right 
brachial plexus approximately 5 cm from the midline"" thought to 
be secondary to radiation fibrosis.  Her symptoms were 
attriubted to C5 radiculopathy secondary to brachial neuritis.  
An EMG/NCV study on [**2985-9-6**] demonstrated ""a moderately severe, 
subacute, right cervical radiculopathy or
 polyradiculopathy, most clearly involving the C5 root.""  She 
was directly admitted to the neurology service for LP and 
further work up. 

ROS:
She notes removing a tick (uncertain size) from her right 
shoulder without subsequent rash several weeks prior to her 
symptom onset for which she ""prophylactically"" took 1 dose of 2 
different antibiotics (name unknown).  She denies having 
fever/vision changes/hearing changes/facial droop. She does 
report having chills when her pain is severe. She has 
generalized arthralgias and myalgias which are chronic.  She has 
noted an occasional, mild headache with her symptoms. No 
photophobia/phonophobia. She denies cough, shortness of breath, 
chest pain, or nausea/vomiting. She complains of constipation 
from the pain medication and was recently seen in the ER for 
severe constipation and manual disimpaction. She denies dysuria 
or urinary retention/incontinence/weight loss. 

 
Past Medical History:
 1.  Breast Cancer - First diagnosed 25yrs ago (right breast)

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the Neuromed service, 
transferred to the MICU, then to the surgery service, back to 
the MICU and then to the APG medicine floor team.

1. Lyme Meningitis- Based on the patient's radiculopathy, 
headache and LP in the ED with 58 WBC (93% Lymphs), 3 RBC, 
mildly elevated protein at 76 and glucose 54.  Repeat serum 
serology demonstrated positive Lyme IgG and IgM serology [**Doctor First Name **] 
(confirmed by Western Blot) in the blood (after just the IgM 
positive results 2 days prior).  Infectious Disease consult 
service was consulted and recommended a 21 day course of 
Ceftriaxone 2 gm qd, begun on [**2985-9-7**].  Her symptoms improved 
somewhat, but she continued to experience aches and pains 
associated with the meningitis.  The neurology service suggested 
that her symptoms might not resolve for weeks, even after 
treatment. Cessation of IV ceftriaxone is [**2985-9-28**]. 

2. Hypotension and Bradycardia-
After 1 day in the hospital the patient developed multiple 
parasympathetic-mediated symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, 
diaphoresis) and was noted to be bradycardic and hypotensive 
(without response to fluids).  She was ruled out for MI.  The 
hypotension was thought to be due to heightened vagal tone vs. 
lyme sepsis vs volume depletion.  Cardiology was consulted to 
consider heart block as a causative [**Doctor Last Name 978**] for her hypotension 
given that an EKG demonstrated 3:2 Secondary Degree Type I A-V 
block; they doubted that heart block was the causative [**Doctor Last Name 978**].  A 
TTE on [**2985-9-6**] demonstrated hyperdynamic, EF 75-80%, 1+ MR, 1+ 
AR, without pericardial effusion.  
 She was admitted to the MICU and placed on a Dopamine drip, 
with resulting normotension.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test showed mild 
adrenal insufficiency with random cortisol level of 14.  She was 
placed on stress dose steroids and weaned off of dopamine after 
24 hours with return to normal sinus rhythm.  Blood cultures to 
date are negative.  Stool cultures were positive for C. Diff.  
She was treated with IV Ceftriaxone, PO Vancomycin, IV flagyl, 
and aggressive IVF.  She was intermittently on the surgery 
service after developing ABD Pain with question of acute 
cholecystitis, but U/S of gallbladder demonstrated only 
distension, without wall thickening, stones, or bile duct 
dilatation. CT ABD had evidence of toxic megacolon and 
gallbladder distension but no other cause for ABD pain.  During 
MICU stay, patient was placed on TPN in setting of C. diff 
colitis and abdominal pain.   

3. Infectious Disease Issues: We are treating C. diff with 
metronidazole, and will continue this treatment 3 days past the 
cessation of the ceftriaxone (last dose on [**2985-10-1**]). Blood 
cultures negative to date.  See above.

4. Pain: Throughout the hospitalization, pain continues and 
still is a primary issue.  Multiple pain regimens have been 
tried. Given Lyme disease, the nature of the patient's pain 
changes unpredictably. She was initially on Gabapentin 800 mg 
tida and IV dilaudid. The Gabapentin had to be titrated up due 
to continued nighttime pain. Pain service was consulted on two 
separate occations. The final regimen, based on their 
recommendations was to increase Gabapentin to 1200 mg tid, add 
oxycodone 10 mg bid with Dilaudid PO 4-6 mg every 4-6 hours. A 
muscle relaxant, Flexeril (5 mg tid) was added to patient's pain 
regimen two days prior to discharge. A benzodiazepine was tried, 
but was stopped due to excessive sedation in setting of pain 
regimen. At [**Hospital1 **], it will be necessary to get pain service 
involved early as her pain will continue for weeks to months 
according to the neurology team. 

5. Pulmonary Issues: She initially had a 4L O2 requirement in 
setting of pleural effusions s/p volume resusitation in the 
MICU. With diuresis, she was eventually able to 
ventilate/oxygenate well without supplemental O2. She was 
diuresed with IV  Lasix and effectively diuresed off more than 
10 L (over a one week period).  Her chronic bronchiectasis was 
not thought to be an issue during this admission.

6. HIT POSITIVE- Her admission Plt level was 370 but dropped to 
a nadir of 129 on [**2985-9-18**].  Heparin products were discontinued 
and she was tested by [**Doctor First Name **] for heparin antibodies (PF4) which 
returned positive.  Hematology was consulted.  Despite the lack 
of true thrombocytopenia (level was never below 129) she was 
diagnosed with Type II HIT given Ab + (which carries a ~50% risk 
of thrombosis at 30-days) and started on an argatroban drip.  
After developing transaminitis and given advantage of qd dosing 
without the need for monitoring levels, she was switched to 
Fondapirinux 2.5 SC QD.  This was overlapped with coumadin with 
a plan to discontinue fondapinanux after therapeutic INR of 
2.0-3 was achieved. At [**Hospital1 **], she will need to have the 
fondaparinux stopped after therapeutic levels (INR 2.0-2.5) are 
achieved on Coumadin.  After diagnosis, she had LE pain and 
LENIs were (-) for DVT.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1130**] in 
Hematology.

6. Nutrition: Given inability to sustain adequate po in the 
setting of C. Diff Colitis, she was started on TPN. Patient will 
need to continue TPN until she has an adequate daily PO caloric 
intake.  

7. Access: Patient currently has a double lumen PICC line placed 
for continued TPN administration.  Given concern for arm 
swelling, she had an upper extremity U/S on [**9-24**] which was 
negative for DVT.
