with CO of RCA and LCx, PAF on coumadin, DMII, DCM (EF 30% with 
severe inferoposterior wall/inferior septum) and HTN who 
presents with NSTEMI (Tn 0.57, CK 195, MB 15) in setting of 
BRBPR (hct 24 with baseline 34).  Pt admitted to MICU, 
transfused 4U PRBC's and 1U FFP with resolution of chest pain.  
INR supratherapeutic at 4.8.  Aspirin and plavix continued due 
to risk of in-stent thrombosis.  EGD revealed Barrett's 
esophagus, non-bleeding erosions and 2 non-bleeding 
benign-looking duodenal polyps.  Continued on PPI and scheduled 
for colonoscopy [**12-5**].  No further bleeding and hct stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  GIB:  Pt was admitted with acute GI bleeding.  He got a 
total of 5 units of PRBC's and 1 unit FFP for his 
supratherapeutic INR.  His CP occured with hct of ~24 (baseline 
36) and resolved with blood transfusion and his hematocrit 
remained stable ~35.  EGD in the MICU revealed short segement of 
Barrett's esophagus, non-erosive gastritis and non-bleeding 
dudenal polyps.  H.pylori serology returned positive, and he 
will be treated with triple therapy for this problem.  He was 
maintained on IV protonix BID for gastric acid suppression.  Pt 
then moved to the floor where he underwent bowel prep and had a 
colonoscopy which revealed 2 sessile benign-appearing polyps 
7-8mm in size that were not removed given the pt's 
anticoagulated state.  Therefore, Mr.[**Known patient lastname **] cause of bleeding was 
likely supratheraputic anticoagulation from an unknown site.  He 
is no longer bleeding and his hematocrit is stable. H.Pylori 
negative.  He will be discharged with protonix 40mg [**Known patient firstname **] BID X [**3-22**] 
weeks.  

2.  NSTEMI:  Pt had evidence of AMI with troponin leak in 
setting of acute hemmorhage.  Pt is paced, so it is impossible 
to definitively rule out acute STEMI, but his serial ekg's did 
not meet sgarbosa's criteria.  However, his history is not 
suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.  He was maintained on 
medical management with aspirin, BB, statin.  He was maintained 
on asprin and plavix (even in setting of acute GIB) to prevent 
acute in-stent thrombosis.  Pt was discharged with his home 
regimen including coreg, digoxin, and imdur.  

3.  PAF:  Pt was VVI-paced at 75 BPM while in house.  His 
coumadin was held.  Mr.[**Known patient lastname **] will not be anticoagulated so his 
ascending colonic polyps can be safely removed in the near 
future.

4.  DM:  Pt was maintained on regular insulin sliding scale 
during this hospitalization.  No evidence of DKA.  

5.  Gout:  Pt with history of gout.  No evidency of acute gouty 
flare.  Remained on [**Known patient firstname **] allopurinol for secondary prophylaxis.

6.  Barrett's Esophagus:  Found on EGD.  Will need follow-up in 
GI clinic for this problem.
