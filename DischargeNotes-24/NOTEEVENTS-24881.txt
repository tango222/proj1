     INDICATION: 88 year of old woman with history of sigmoid volvulus.  Presents
     with acute onset of abdominal pain, distention and nausa.  Evaluate for
     volvulus vs obstruction.
     
     COMPARISON: 
     
     ABDOMEN, SUPINE AND UPRIGHT VIEWS:  There is a markedly dilated loop of colon
     occupying the majority of the abdomen which has an appearance consistent with
     a dilated sigmoid secondary to sigmoid volvulus.  There is no evidence of
     pneumatosis and no free air is seen.  Gas is seen througout the length of the
     colon. No abnormally dilated loops of small bowel are seen.  There is an IVC
     filter. There are marked degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Sigmoid volvulus.

Admission Date:  [**2735-8-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2735-9-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2646-9-20**]       Sex:  F

Service:  GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year old
female with past medical history of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, congestive heart failure and atrial
fibrillation, sigmoid volvulus history about one year ago
reduced with colonoscopy.  The patient did well until one day
prior to admission when she developed increased abdominal
girth with nausea, vomiting and no bowel movements for the
past day.  The patient had a KUB that showed sigmoid
volvulus.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  History of deep vein thrombosis.
5.  Hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Right tibial fracture repair.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Valium.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Zantac 150 mg.
2.  Lasix 60 mg.
3.  Levoxyl 125.
4.  Prozac 10 mg.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg once daily.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was
afebrile, vital signs were stable.  The patient had
normoactive bowel sounds, distended, tympanitic, minimally
tender.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 19.0 with 90 neutrophils, 3
bands, hematocrit 48.5, platelet count 232,000.  Potassium
3.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent sigmoidoscopy which
accomplished decompression and resolution of volvulus.  A #28
French chest tube was placed across the area of the volvulus.
Tube was draining well fecal material.  Abdominal distention
was decreased.  On hospital day three, it was noted that the
rectal tube had become obstructed with fecal drainage coming
around the tube.  Temperature had risen to 102.6 overnight.
On examination, the abdomen had become distended again.
Decision was made to undergo sigmoid colectomy with end
colostomy and [**Doctor Last Name **] procedure.  The patient was admitted to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively intubated
for blood pressure control.  The patient was extubated
postoperative day one.  The patient was felt to be ready for
transfer to the floor after some blood pressure issues that
were resolved in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient
finally was transferred to the floor on postoperative day six
after some delay due to placement.  Postoperative day seven
the patient was with no complaints, tolerating soft solids,
on tube feeds, vital signs stable, abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds, incision clean, dry
and intact.  Postoperative day eight the patient continued to
be afebrile with vital signs stable.  The patient is now
tolerating thick liquids.  The patient was advanced to pureed
foods, and Foley was discontinued.  Postoperative day nine,
the patient continued to do well with no complaints,
tolerating pureed solids well.  The patient had inadvertently
pulled out feeding tube shortly before the morning rounds.
As the patient was taking good p.o. intake, it was felt that
the feeding tube was no longer necessary.  The patient
continued to be afebrile and vital signs were stable.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  The incision was clean, dry and intact.  The
patient was awaiting rehabilitation placement.  The patient
will be going to a rehabilitation facility and will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the following week.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility to be named at
a later date.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy,
[**Doctor Last Name 5723**] procedure.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Hypothyroidism.

FOLLOW-UP: The patient will be following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

     adominal pain and KUB demonstrating likely sigmoid volvulus.
     
     THERAPEUTIC GASTROGRAFIN ENEMA: Initial scout images of the abdomen reveal a
     markedly dilated sigmoid colon measuring up to 14 cm in diameter.  No free air
     or pneumatosis is seen. A rectal tube was placed and approximately 2 [**11-28**]
     liters of dilute Gastrografin contrast were administered.  Contrast was
     demonstrated within the sigmoid and also passed beyond this sigmoid into the
     descending colon.  No extravasation of contrast was identified. The sigmoid
     colon was not compressed by the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION: Partial sigmoid volvulus with contrast passing into descending
     colon.  Unsuccessful decompression of the sigmoid.

     proximal transverse colon.  A paucity of bowel gas is noted in the descending
     colon.  A small amount of contrast is also present in the nondistended
     transverse colon.  Air is present in the splenic flexure and in the stomach.
     The patient has a caval filter identified.  No free air is identified.
     Extensive degenerative changes are present in the lumbar spine.  When compared
     with the prior study from [**2735-8-31**] there has been slight decrease in the extent
     of dilatation of the cecum and ascending colon.

     INDICATION:  Status post sigmoid colectomy.  Check for CHF and atelectasis.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP semi-upright image.  Comparison study dated [**2735-9-1**].
     There is again evidence of fairly marked LV enlargement of the heart,
     associated with unfolded of the aorta.  The pulmonary vessels show slight
     upper zone redistribution and there is blurring of vascular detail at the
     bases, suggestive of moderate LV decompensation.  Small bibasilar effusions
     cannot be ruled out.  The tip of the SG catheter appears to have moved from
     the interlobar pulmonary artery into the right upper lobar artery.  The ET
     tube has been removed and the NG tube has been removed.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     The appearances suggest LV enlargement with some left heart failure, more
     marked than on the prior study.  Follow up is recommended.

     CHEST, PORTABLE AP, [**2735-9-4**]
     
     INDICATION:  CHF, status post sigmoidcolectomy.
        Right central venous line inserted.  Check position of line and rule-out
     pneumothorax.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP supine image.  Comparison study dated [**2735-9-3**].  The
     right IJ pulmonary venous catheter has been removed and the new right IJ
     central line inserted.  Its tip is in satisfactory position at the SVC/right
     atrial junction.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  The heart again
     shows fairly marked left ventricular enlargement and there is evidence of
     dilatation unfolding and calcification of the aortic arch.  The pulmonary
     vessels are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of cardiac failure at this
     time.  The lungs show some minor atelectasis in the left mid zone and there is
     also atelectasis/infiltrate in the left lower lobe behind the heart.  Slight
     blunting of the costophrenic angles could indicate small bilateral pleural
     effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory placement of new right IJ central line.  No
     pneumothorax.  Lv enlargement and possible LV decompensation noted.
