Admission Date:  [**3498-2-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**3498-2-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**3417-3-29**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old female
with type II diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
who is being treated for pneumonia at rehabilitation with
levofloxacin with she developed fever, wheezing and decreased
blood pressure on [**2-2**].  In the Emergency Department
at [**Hospital1 770**], temperatures were noted to be 101�� with a heart
rate of 125, blood pressure of 102/51, respiratory rate of 28
and patient was 99% on nonrebreather and 94% on 3 liters of
O2.  Her blood pressure decreased to 60/palp requiring
intravenous fluid.  There is no infiltrate noted on chest
x-ray, but treated with ceftriaxone as well as Zosyn.
Arterial blood gases in the Emergency Room at that time was
noted to be a pH of 7.33, CO2 of 55, O2 of 107 on 3 liters of
O2.

On the medical records from the outside hospital, the patient
was noted to have a recent experience of chest pain at rest
as well as with exertion.  It is unclear from the medical
records whether the chest pain was new versus chronic and
whether there was a progressive component to this.  The
patient was treated as a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation with nebulizers and steroids and the
patient had cardiac enzymes cycled.  The patient was not
given a beta blocker or aspirin.  The patient was emergently
intubated on [**2-3**] in the a.m. for respiratory
distress.  Arterial blood gases at that time was noted to
have a pH of 7.19, PCO2 of 68 and an O2 of 76.

CKs peaked at the outside hospital at 188 with an MB of 21
and an index of 11.7 on the morning of [**2-3**].  The
patient was also noted to have the evolution of T-wave
inversions in the lateral and inferior leads.  She was
diuresed with Lasix 60 mg intravenous total.  A beta blocker
still was not added on at that time.  The patient also did
not receive aspirin until [**2-3**] in the p.m. secondary
to a questionable aspirin allergy.  Heparin drip was started
on [**2-3**] in the evening and the patient was also
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  The patient
was then transferred to [**Hospital6 84**]
for further work up including cardiac catheterization.  On
arrival to [**Hospital6 84**], the patient
was arousable and denied any chest pain or any other pain.

11.1 with a first set of CKs.

X-RAYS:  Electrocardiogram from [**2-2**] showed normal
sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, slight left axis
deviation, normal interval with a borderline QTC, 0.[**Street Address 1087**]
elevations in V3 through V6, T-waves in V5 through V6, as
well as 1 in AVL.  There are Q-waves noted.  Good R-wave
progression.  Electrocardiogram from [**2-4**] at [**Hospital6 283**] was normal sinus rhythm in

anterior fascicular block, no Qs, no ST changes, deep and
wide T-wave inversions in V2 through V6, 2, 3 and AVF.  Early
R-wave progression.  Chest x-ray revealed hyperinflation,
flattened diaphragms consistent with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  AP film revealed mild congestive heart
failure.  No focal infiltrate.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 80-year-old female with type II
diabetes, hypertension, tobacco history, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who was admitted to [**Hospital 770**] Hospital on
[**2-2**] with pneumonia and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.  He appeared to have an
ischemic event.  On the night of [**2-2**] there was
evolution of infarct in the inferior and lateral leads by the
a.m. of [**2-3**].  The patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital6 84**] for cardiac
catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIAC:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization lab on [**3498-2-4**].  Findings included:
One vessel coronary artery disease, left main coronary artery
had mild disease, the LAD had an ulcerated 70% proximal
stenosis and a 50% mid lesion, the left circumflex and RCA
had mild diffuse disease, mild elevation of the wedge
pressure noted at 15 mmHg, mild PA hypertension with a
pressure of 37/15 and status post successful direct stenting
to the LAD.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without
any complications.  Post catheter checks revealed no bruit or
hematoma.

Post catheter, the patient was started on a regimen which
included aspirin, Plavix, Captopril, Lopressor and her
cholesterol labs were checked.  Doses of medication were
incrementally increased based on blood pressure and at the
time of discharge, the patient was maintained on a dose of
Zestril 40 mg po q day and atenolol 37.5 mg po q day.  In
light of the patient's history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and likely concomitant chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient's beta blocker
dose was slowly increased, however the patient tolerated all
dose adjustments without any respiratory decompensation.

PUMP:  The patient had an echocardiogram on [**3498-2-4**]
which revealed an ejection fraction of 20%.  Other findings
included severe global left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis,
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right
ventricle and 1+ mitral regurgitation.  Based on these
findings, the patient was started on a heparin drip as well
as Coumadin for cardiac thrombus prophylaxis.  It was the
feeling of the CCU team that repeat evaluation of ejection
fraction via echocardiogram would be beneficial to evaluate
for the necessity of long term anticoagulation in a patient
with a non Q-wave myocardial infarction.  Initially, during
patient's stay in the CCU, she was noted to be in mild
congestive heart failure and was diuresed gently with Lasix.
The patient had good urine output and was noted to have
improved O2 saturations with this diuresis.  Towards the end
of her hospital stay, the patient was saturating well and did
not require any further Lasix diuresis.

RHYTHM:  Initially, on admission to the CCU, the patient was
noted to be in a sinus bradycardia and atropine and pacer
pads were placed at the bedside.  The patient's vital signs
with this bradycardic rhythm remained stable and subsequently
the patient's rate gradually increased and remained in the
70s to 90s for the remainder of the hospital stay.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with questionable
pneumonia at outside hospital.  The patient was treated with
steroids and nebulizers, as well as Zosyn and Tequin at the
outside hospital.  On admission to [**Hospital6 1288**], the patient was placed on an antibiotic
regimen of Zithromax and Rocephin.  In addition, the patient
was continued on Solu-Medrol and nebulizers prn.  In
addition, as above, the patient arrived to [**Hospital6 283**] intubated and was
successfully extubated on [**3498-1-8**] without much
difficulty.  The patient's shortness of breath and wheezing
improved on this regimen and on [**1-8**], decision was
made to switch from intravenous steroids to po prednisone.
The patient was to be tapered slowly on this medication.  In
addition, the patient remained afebrile and no definite
infiltrate was noted radiographically and decision was made
to discontinue antibiotics.  The patient was switched from
nebulizer treatment to metered dose inhalers and was
receiving Serevent, albuterol and Atrovent metered dose
inhalers at the time of discharge.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to be anemic on
admission with a hematocrit of 28.7, status post 1 unit of
packed red blood cells at the outside hospital.  The patient
was transferred an additional 2 units of packed red blood
cells on admission in light of upcoming cardiac
catheterization.  On [**1-9**], the patient was noted to
have oozing of blood from her right femoral catheter site as
well as the right antecubital fossa.  In addition, the
patient was noted to have one to two episodes of melanotic
stools.  At this time, the patient's PTT was noted to be
supertherapeutic at 150.  Heparin and Coumadin were
discontinued and serial hematocrits were followed.  The
patient was noted to have a slightly decrease in hematocrit
likely secondary to all this bleeding and was transfused an
additional 1 unit of packed red blood cells.  Melanotic
stools were then noted to resolve and oozing from the groin
site was noted to stop with a pressure dressing applied.  For
the remainder of the hospital stay, the patient's hematocrit
remained stable requiring no further transfusion.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient with a history of diabetes,
insulin requiring.  It was unclear from the medical records
sent from the outside hospital what the patient's usual
regimen was.  The patient was maintained on a regular insulin
sliding scale with fingerstick blood sugars qid.  The
patient's fingersticks were noted to be elevated and the
decision was made to add on extending dose of NPH in the
morning and evening for more long-term coverage.  Initially,
the patient was started on NPH 4 units subcutaneous bid and
at the time of discharge, the patient was receiving 12 units
bid.  The patient's blood sugars were somewhat better
controlled with this regimen, however further incremental
increase in NPH would likely be required.

5.  RENAL:  The patient's creatinine remained stable while an
inpatient at [**Hospital6 84**] and there
were no active issues.

6.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient is status post a motor
vehicle accident in [**3497-11-6**] requiring rehabilitation
stay.  The patient intermittently complained of left sided
chest pain which was noted to be reproducible with
palpitation over a prominent left lower rib.  Initially, the
patient's chest pain was treated with narcotics, including
morphine.  However, the patient was switched to nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory medications for pain control towards the end
of her hospital stay.

7.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on Protonix and
subcutaneous heparin/heparin drip.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to
rehabilitation.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      80 F s/p NQMI, extubated [**2-5**], with persistent wheezing, blood-tinged
      secretions, please eval for pna/failure/chronic process (pt reports lung

     HISTORY: Persistent wheezing and blood tinged secretions. History of
     questionable lung nodules in the past.
     
     AP chest, one view: Since the prior study of 7.5 hours earlier, there is no
     significant interval change. The patient is rotated. The lungs are
     hyperinflated. There is no vascular congestion, focal consolidation, or
     pleural effusion. There is nodular density at the upper most left apex, seen
     on the recent exams. More remote studies from outside hospitals are not
     available for comparison. If these can be obtained, we would be happy to make
     a comparison and issue an addendum. There are clips in the upper abdomen
     towards the right.
     
     IMPRESSION: No pneumonia or CHF. Left apical ill-defined density, of uncertain
     etiology. Recommend comparison with more remote studies to assess for
     stability of this finding.

     COMPARISON; [**3498-2-5**]
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST, ONE VIEW: Since the prior exam, the ET tube and NG tube
     have been removed.  The heart is normal in size. The lungs are hyperinflated,
     but otherwise clear without vascular congestion, focal consolidation or
     pleural effusion.  There is vague illdefined nodular density at the left apex,
     seen on recent [**Hospital1 550**] studies.  Recommend comparison with more remote studies
     to insure stability of this finding.  There are clips in the right upper
     abdomen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No pneumonia or CHF.
     2. Illdefined nodular density at the left apex for which comparison with
