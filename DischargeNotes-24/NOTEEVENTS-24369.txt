                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  75 y/o woman status post shunt revision with vomiting and diplopia.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT study of [**2545-3-5**] and MR study of [**2545-3-8**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no mass
     effect or shift of normally midline structures.  The frontal horns of the
     lateral ventricles are small.  The remainder of the ventricles, sulci and
     cisterns are unremarkable.  Again seen is a ventricular catheter, terminating
     in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 79**].  There are multiple areas of low attenuation in the
     cerebellum and cerebellar hemispheres, unchanged in appearance from the prior
     studies, likely representing chronid infarctions.  There is no significant
     change in the previously seen pituitary fossa mass.  The visualized paranasal
     sinuses are clear.  Bone windows demonstrate again a frontal craniotomy
     defect.  No fractures identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute bleed or shift of normally midline structures.

Admission Date:  [**2545-4-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2545-5-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2469-7-20**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
gentleman with a history of hydrocephalus with a couple of
revisions of ventriculoperitoneal shunt who was admitted on
[**2545-4-27**] with decreased mental status.  It was found the
patient's ventriculoperitoneal shunt was not working.  The
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 4**]
for further evaluation and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hydrocephalus.
2.  Pituitary microadenoma.
3.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Sinus surgery.
2.  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement plus revision.
3.  Status post appendectomy.
4.  Frontal sinus surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to
the Neurosurgery Service.  He underwent ventriculoperitoneal
shunt revision of his new shunt and valve placement.

1.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  Initially, after the operation, the
patient showed an improvement in mental status changes.
However, on [**2545-5-7**] the patient's mental status started
to deteriorate again, to the point where he became
unresponsive.  He had to be intubated and
transferred to the intensive Unit.  At the same time, the
patient's
white blood cell count decreased.  He spiked a fever.  He had
a computed tomography scan of the head which showed dilated
ventricles.  The patient's reservoir was accessed with [**Known patient firstname **]
pus expressed.  The VP shunt was externalized.

For the next four weeks the patient had multiple drain
revisions due to poor flow and clogging by cell debris.  All
changes were made on the right side with left side being
saved for potential ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in
the future.

The patient's mental status was depressed with localizing
bilaterally and withdrawing to pain; however, this level was
intermittently changing, mostly in correlation with well
functioning of ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  On [**2545-5-30**], the
patient's mental status was slightly
improving with eyes opening and spontaneous movement of all
extremities.  However, in the evening of that day, after his
tracheostomy was suctioned, the patient's blood pressure
increased to 190.  After that, he had bright red blood
showing up in his drain, and his pupils became nonreactive.
On examination, he was not moving extremities and was not
withdrawing from pain.  He did not have gag reflex.

He underwent an emergency head computed tomography scan which
showed very large hemorrhage in the left hemisphere with
midline shift
and herniation. 
His repeat examination was the same.  The patient had two
apnea tests which were both showed no spontaneous respirations..

On [**2545-5-31**], after discussing with the patient 's family his
ventilator was disconnected the patient expired.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient's blood pressure was
somewhat labile throughout the whole stay in the hospital;
however, mostly staying in the 90 to 150 range,
intermittently requiring a Nipride drip and neosynephrine in
order
to meet blood pressure parameters.

On [**5-30**], after right hemispheric bleed, the patient's
blood pressure was low, requiring neosynephrine for blood pres
sure
support.

3.  RESPIRATORY:  The patient remained intubated for all that
time.  Intermittently, the patient was on continuous positive
airway pressure with pressure support; however, we were
unable to wean him off the ventilator because of his poor
mental status.  Given the chronicity of the problems, the
patient underwent a tracheostomy on [**2545-5-21**].

On [**2545-5-30**] and [**2545-5-31**] the patient had an apnea
test both of which he failed and expired upon withdrawing
ventilator support.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Once transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit, the patient had a nasogastric tube placed and was
started on tube feeds.  Also on [**2545-5-23**], the patient
had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement and
was continued on tube feeds per percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube.  Throughout his stay in the hospital, there
were no concerns or issues with gastrointestinal tract or
liver.

5.  RENAL:  The patient continued having good urinary output.
No renal issues.

6.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  In the beginning of the patient's
Intensive Care Unit stay, he developed signs of syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone with low
serum sodium.  However, it was corrected by fluid
restriction.  The patient was intermittently receiving doses
of dexamethasone to decrease his edema; otherwise,
unremarkable.

7.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Concurrently with the patient's
initial decompensation on [**2545-5-7**] he was found to have a
urinary tract infection.  Once the initial VP shunt was
accessed and drained, it was cultured which eventually grew
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pan-sensitive enterococcus.  The
patient was initially treated with vancomycin, gentamicin,
and ceftazidime; however, later on it was switched to
vancomycin and gentamicin.

Also, for a period of about two weeks, the patient was
receiving IT injections of gentamicin.  Approximately after
one week of initial antibiotic treatment, his urinary tract
infection cleared.  His cerebrospinal fluid had cleared also,
and the last three consecutive cultures were negative for
bacteria.

8.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient was seen by Physical
Therapy and Occupational Therapy.  He had no active issues.

Once it was evident the patient was taking a turn for the
worse on [**2545-5-30**], the patient's family was contacted
who arrived to be with the patient.  The situation and
prognosis were explained by both the primary team as well as
the Intensive Care Unit team.

The family changed the patient's status to do not
resuscitate/do not intubate and then eventually to comfort
measures only, and the patient expired after withdrawing
respiratory support.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Death.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient's body was released to
the family.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Hydrocephalus; status post ventriculoperitoneal shunt
revision.
 2.  Status post ventricular drain placement.
 3.  Status post meningitis.
 4.  Status post ventriculitis.
 5.  Status post left cerebral hemisphere bleed.
 6.  Status post cerebral herniation.
 7.  Hypertension.
 8.  Failure to thrive.
 9.  Respiratory failure.
10.  Urinary tract infection.

     FINDINGS:  Compared to the study 5 days prior, there is now prominent
     dilatation of the ventricular system.  Again seen is a ventricular catheter
     traversing the right frontal lobe, and terminating in the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 79**].
     In addition to the dilated ventricles, there is air present in the non-
     dependent portions.  Despite the dilatation of the ventricles, there is no
     discernable effacement of the sulci or midline shift.  Again seen are multiple
     areas of hypoattenuation in the cerebellum and cerebellar hemispheres,
     reflecting of chronic infarction, unchanged since the prior study.  Previously
     seen pituitary fossa mass is again identified and remains unchanged.  There is
     a frontal epidural collection, unchanged from the prior study, most likely
     post-operative in nature.  Again seen are craniotomy defects on the bone
     windows. Images through the mid brain show regions of calcific arachnoiditis.
     
     These findings were communicated to [**Doctor First Name 14**] at the time of the interpretation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval development of moderate pan-ventricular dilatation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Mucous plugging.
     
     Comparison is made to previous chest radiograph dated one day earlier.
     
     An endotracheal tube remains in place, with the tip terminating at
     approximately the level of thoracic inlet, about 8 cm above the carina.  A
     nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm.  A catheter traversing the right
     hemithorax and projecting over the left upper abdomen likely represents a VP
     shunt catheter.
     
     Allowing for rotation of the patient, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     considered within normal limits.  The right lung appears clear.  Within the
     left lung, there is some patchy opacity within the retrocardiac region which
     does not obscure the hemidiaphragm.
     
     The left costophrenic angle has been excluded from the radiograph and cannot
     be assessed.  The right costophrenic sulcus appears clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Small patchy focus of increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region.
     Differential diagnosis includes patchy atelectasis, aspiration, and early
     pneumonia.  Follow up radiographs may be helpful.
     
     2.  Slightly proximal location of endotracheal tube, terminating approximately
     8 cm above the carina.

     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     INDICATION:  75 year old male status-post shunt revision with double vision
     and vomiting. Evaluate for increased ventricular size.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT imaging of the brain. Comparison is made to a
     prior study from the previous day.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is evidence of moderate increase in size of the ventricles
     when compared to the prior day's examination. At this time, the ventricular
     system is mild to moderately dilated, most evident involving the fourth
     ventricle.  There is evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, with a tiny
     amount high attenuation material within the dependent portion of the left
     lateral ventricle. There is an unchanged appearance of a drainage catheter
     within the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 79**]. There is a stable appearance of a right- sided
     low attenuation lesion consistent with chronic microvascular infarct. There is
     no evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct. There is no evidence
     of shift of normally mid-line structures. There is dense calcification of the
     vertebral, basilar and carotid arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Generally moderate increase in  size of the ventricular system when
     compared to the previous day.
     
     These findings were relayed shortly after interpretation to the neurosurgical
     team responsible for this patient's care.

Pt had an eventful day. At 0730 pt was found to have a temp of 102.8 His neuro assessment did not coincide with that from the previous shift and pt. was found to be less reponsive. At this point he was able to say his wife's name but speech was garbled and he did not focus his eyes nor follow commands.  Neuro sicu team notified. Within an hour pt became unresponsive. Pt was pan cx'd including blood cx's X2, urine cx, and culture of thick yellow discharge on pt's meatus.  During this pt started coughing and ? vomitus on his gown. NT sx'd for thick yellow/tan secretions appearing almost like bile mixed with tube feeds, but unclear. Residual checked just prior and revealed 50cc residual. Sputum Sent for CX and ng placed on sx. 
  CXR done and ABG drawn 7.48/35/186/27. ABG drawn d/t pt's sats dropping after he started his coughing spell. Pt was somewhat tachypneic and sats dropped to 88% on 4l. Placed on FT w/ 60%Fio2 with sats increasing to 97%. Pt was then taken to heat CT which apparently revealed that the shunt placed [**5-5**] was working however there was some air that may be the cause or adding to his change in mental status.
   Review of systems:
Neuro: Since ~2:30pm pt has become more responsive. Follows simple commands ie, smile. He is also moving all extremities upper more than lower. Pupils unchanged and cont to be reactive. Answers yes and no questions and was interacting slowly with family.

CV: vss. Pt's BP was elevated this am with increase in temp and coughing and required Lopressor 5mg IV X! with effect. Currently pt's Bp has been 140-150's/70's. No ectopy. Good pedal pulses, extremities warm.  On po hydralazine Q6hr with good effect.

RESP: Fio2 decreased to 40% FT for humidification. lungs are less coarse...appear clear but difficult to assess as pt does not take lg breaths. Dim t/o. Coughing has diminished. Receivin neb tx's per resp.

GI: Tube feeds held when pt was noted to be coughing and he's been NPO except meds with small amounts of water. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ok to take NG off suction since no more ouput stopped. Will cont to be NPO tonight. Abd soft with good bos. Pt has had several small brown smears of stool t/o day.

     The previously identified left lower lobe patchy opacity has been markedly
     improved. The lungs are clear otherwise. The nasogastric tube courses toward
     the stomach. The heart is normal in size. Again note is made of mild
     tortuousity of the thoracic aorta with calcification. There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax. There is revised VP shunt coursing overlying the right side of
     the thoracic spine. The distal portion of the VP shunt is not clearly seen.

     COMPARISON:  CT head, [**2545-5-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT head with no IV contrast.
     
     CT HEAD WITH NO IV CONTRAST:  The patient is status post placement of
     a ventricular shunt via the right frontal approach and its end appears to have
     been slightly pulled back since the prior study, but still apposing to the
     lateral wall of the third ventricle.  There is interval decrease in the amount
     of air in the ventricles.  The ventricles are not enlarged in size. There is
     also a small amount of air along the track of the ventricular shunt. A chronic
     extraaxial collection is again seen in the frontal region.  There is no
     evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no shift of the normally
     midline structures.  Multiple foci of decreased density are noted in the
     periventricular white matter, indicative of microvascular infarcts.
     
     Bone windows reveal again postsurgical changes in the frontal bone and
     sinuses.
     
     Coarse vascular calcifications are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of hydrocephalus.  Interval decrease in the amount of
     pneumocephalus.  The ventricular shunt appears slightly pulled back since the
     prior study, but its end still appears to be at least apposed to the lateral
     wall of the third ventricle.

     NONCONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Noncontrast CT scan of the brain.
     
     FINDINGS:   Since the prior study of 6/6,  there has been development of
     massive dilatation of the ventricular system, particularly the fourth
     ventricle which is enormously dilated.  There is the presence of a right
     lateral ventricular drainage catheter with a small amount of gas along the
     catheter tract.  There is also small amount of hemorrhage in the dependent
     portion of the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 79**]. There is no new parenchymal hemorrhage
     identified. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
     
     CONCLUSION: Massive interval dilatation of the ventricular system. The
     surgical ICU resident was notified immediately of this finding with
     anticipated  expeditious notification of the neurosurgical team as well.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  75 y/o man status post VP shunt revision.  Status post
     intubation for mucus plugging.  Now with increased respiratory rate.  Evaluate
     for right sided effusion or infiltrate.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A single AP view of the chest is provided.
     
     FINDINGS:  Again are noted areas of increased density in both lung bases
     consistent with pulmonary infiltrates.  Compared with the previous film from
     [**2545-5-12**], there is a slight improvement in the aeration of both lung bases.
     The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  The mediastinum is
     unremarkable.  An NG tube is noted and, although its distal tip is not
     visualized, it seems to be within the stomach.  A left subclavian line is also
     demonstrated with the distal tip at the level of the confluence between the
     brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.  ET tube is approximately 2 cm
     above the carina and correctly positioned.  No clear pneumothorax is
     demonstrated.  A linear density seen in the periphery of the left lung is most
     likely related to skin fold and seems to be pulmonary vasculature lateral to
     this linear density.  A repeat x-ray is suggested to confirm this finding.
     There are degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Bibasilar pulmonary infiltrates.  Mild improvement compared with previous
     film from [**2545-5-12**].
     2)  Correct positioning of IV lines and ET tube.
     3)  Linear density in the left lung likely artifactual.  Recommend repeat
     chest x-ray. Findings communicated to the medical team at the time of the
     examination.

      75 year old man w/ NPH now with externalized VP drain, pseudomonas meningitis 
      and poor mental status
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please evaluate ventricles and drain placement                                  
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  MPH, externalized VP drain, Pseudomonas meningitis and poor
     mental status.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the skull base to the
     cranial vertex pre and post-administration of 100 cc Optiray.  Non-ionic
     contrast was used secondary to patient debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2545-5-17**]
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval decrease in size of the ventricles.  The
     ventricular catheter terminates in the region of the 3rd ventricle. There is a
     small amount of hemorrhage along the tract of the catheter. Again noted is a
     small extra-axial collection anteriorly.  There is no mass effect or shift of
     normally mid-line structures.  Again noted is a suprasellar mass lesion, which
     has been identified on prior studies.  No meningeal enhancement is appreciated
     after contrast administration.  Also again noted are calcifications at the
     level of the foramen magnum.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Interval decompression of the ventricular system.
     2)  No evidence for a meningeal enhancement.  Please note that meningitis
     cannot be excluded by the lack of enhancement by CT.

     INDICATION: Fixed and dilated pupils.  Status post shunt revision.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2545-5-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large left frontoparietal intracranial hemorrhage,
     probably acute on chronic given layering of blood products, which extends into
     the left temporal lobe.  There is a moderate amount of mass effect, with shift
     of the normally midline structures, and subfalcine herniation.  This
     hemorrhage dissects into both lateral ventricles and into the fourth
     ventricle.  A drainage catheter is noted within the third ventricle, and there
     is a small bubble of gas within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 79**] of the right lateral
     ventricle. The ventricles are considerately more dilated [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1991**] [**5-18**]. There
     is a moderate amount of parenchymal edema, substantially increased since the
     previous exam. Hypodensity involving the white matter areas of the right
     cerebrum has increased slightly in the interval.  There is probably tonsilar
     herniation as well.
     
     The anterior aspects of the frontal lobes has been excluded bilaterally, but
     the decision was made by the clinical ICU team to remove the patient from the
     CT scanner without further imaging.
     
     The patient is status post frontal craniotomy.  Mucosal thickening is noted
     within the ethmoid sinuses bilaterally, and there is fluid within the left
     sphenoid sinus.
     
     IMPRESSION: Large left intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular
     extent, a moderate amount of mass effect, and subfalcine herniation. There may
     also be tonsillar herniation. Findings were discussed with the clinical team
     at the time of image aquisition, and the patient was removed from the scanner
     promptly.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to film dated [**2545-5-18**].
     
     A tracheostomy tube is in place.  An enteric tube is present, its tip within
     the proximal stomach.  The tip of the left subclavian central venous catheter
     is either in the SVC or just shy of it in the left brachycephalic vein.
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged on this supine film.
     There is improved aeration in the right lung base.  There is still nonspecific
     patchy increased density in the left retrocardiac area, without significant
     change.  There is also minimal patchy increased density more laterally at the
     left base, not as clearly seen previously.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.
     The lateral costophrenic angles are sharp without effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Improved aeration right base.
     2. No change patchy left retrocardiac density.
     3. Minimal patchy increased density more laterally in left base, not clearly
     appreciated on the prior film.

     INDICATION:  Assess for CHF. 
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from  6:24 a.m the same
     day.  The previously noted tracheostomy tube and central venous catheter
     remain in place. The tip of the feeding tube is in the proximal stomach. There
     is no definite change in the appearance of the lung parenchyma. There is still
     patchy increased density at the left base. This appears slightly more
     pronounced than on the earlier film, possibly simply reflecting differences in
     patient positioning. No definite new air space infiltrate is seen. There is no
     overt CHF or pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:   1. No change in tubes or catheters.
     
     2. Persistent patchy increased density left base.  Increased prominence on the
     current film could be a consequence of differences in patient positioning,
     although the possibility of some worsening aeration here may be considered.
