History of Present Illness:
55 year old man with PMH of HIV, alcohol abuse, and PCP presents 
with fever and diarrhea x 5 days. He reports that he was started 
on HAART a few months ago, but had gone on an alcoholic binge 
and decided not to take the HAART. Around Patriot's Day he had 
some diarrhea which he attributed to HAART. He was very weak 
during this period and stopped taking the HAART, after which he 
felt significantly better for 2 days. Over the next few days, 
the patient has had predominantly diarrhea with only [**11-24**] solid 
BM's, subjective fevers and soaking night sweats, mild cough 
productive of clear mucus. He is very weak and lethargic. His 
friends told him that he looked [**Last Name (LF) 4451**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he called his PCP's 
office and came into the ED. [**Hospital1 1220**] was on diversion so he came to 
[**Hospital1 25**] instead.  
.  
In the ED, his initial BP was 88/54 and he had a temp of 100.9. 
He was given 4L of NS with no improvement of his blood pressure 
to 80/45. He received vanc/levo/flagyl and a code sepsis was 
called. CT abdomen/pelvis showed no pathology, and CXR showed no 
pneumonia. He received another 1L of fluid but CVP was >8 so he 
was started on levophed and admitted to the FICU for sepsis.  
. 
FICU course: Initially on vanc/levo/flagyl. Stabilized and off 
pressors within 12hrs. US with evidence of acute 
cholecystitis(?) - added cefepime for broader GM NEG coverage. 
On [**3-19**], he spiked to 103.3 and on [**3-20**]: Hemolysis noted on labs 
-> marked hemolysis requiring 2 units transfusion overnight. Due 
to ongoing temp spikes and hypoxia, cefepime was changed to 
meropenem. Heme saw and ruled out TTP-HUS. He also had BMBX for 
pancytopenia. MICRO studies sent in FICU: Cdiff, Blood cultures, 
sputum for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4452**] VL, Stool O and P, galactomannin, B glucan.  

. 
A code purple was called in the FICU prior to transfer as 
patient wanted to leave. Controlled with Haldol. Upon arrival to 
the floor on [**3-30**], he trigerred for hypoxia, tachycardia, had a 
fever of 100.8, tremors -> from anxiety. Treated with nebs, 
ativan/haldol, bl/urine cx drawn.  
.  
ROS: Reports that stomach is distended. Has lost 20 pounds over 
the last 6 weeks. Fever, chills, sweats, cough, diarrhea (mucus 
watery stool) as per HPI. Has some associated abdominal pain 
lasting less than 10 seconds, LLQ, crampy while in hospital. 
Also has nausea and vomiting. Feels generally ill. Has some SOB 
at baseline, variable. Denies chest pain. Hasn't been able to 
hold much food down - last time was 2 days PTA, could eat a 
little pasta down. Has been able to keep liquids down.  
 
Past Medical History:
HIV, diagnosed in [**2582**], on and off various HAART regimens. Last 
CD4 22 in 12/06 and VL > 500K
Pneumocystis pneumonia - multiple times (last time over a year 
ago)
Alcohol abuse - last drink [**3-7**]
COPD
 
Social History:
Lives alone. Partnerl died in [**2584**], smokes 1 ppd from 2 ppd for 
30 years. Drinks 12+ beers per day when drinking (in binges). 
Worked as house painter.

PE: Tm 101.9 Tc 99.1 P 104 BP 115/66 R21 97% 2L NC CVP 8 SVO2 
55%
Gen: Appears acutely ill, no respiratory distress, able to give

Resp: end expiratory wheezes all areas, no crackles
CV: tachy distant nl s1s2 no M
Ext: Soft NTND hyperactive bowel sounds
Neuro: CN [**1-4**] intact, strength intact in UE and LE.
 
Pertinent Results:
EKG: NSR at 83, NL axis, no ST/T wave changes. No previous for 
comparison.
.
CXR:  Two views of the chest demonstrate clear lungs, normal 
cardiac and mediastinal contours, and unremarkable osseous 
structures. 
IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia. 
.
CT Abd:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Splenomegaly. 
2.  Diffusely prominent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph[**MD Number 2082**] which overall do not meet CT criteria for pathologic 
enlargement. 
3.  Small amount of free fluid within the abdomen. 
4.  Fatty liver. 
5.  Equivocal cholelithiasis. 
. 
RUQ ULTRASOUND to evaluate ""equivocal"" cholelithiasis as source 
of sepsis: 
ADDENDUM:  Upon re-evaluation of the sonographic images, as well 
as further clinical information, the findings are less 
suggestive of acute cholecystitis. The patient has 
hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 2.8 on [**2596-3-17**] (one day 
prior to the ultrasound) and current albumin level of 1.7, 
approximately four days later. Gallbladder wall edema and 
pericholecystic fluid, as seen on the ultrasound, can be often 
seen in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Additionally the 
gallbladder is not tense and distended as is usually seen in 
cholecystitis. Finally, the patient has a history of HIV and 
could be presenting with AIDS related cholangiopathy to account 
for his symptoms. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Gallbladder wall edema, most likely secondary to acute 
cholecystitis. 
2.  Common bile duct is mildly dilated, measuring 7 mm; however, 
no stone is seen within the CBD. 
3.  The liver demonstrates increased echogenicity with 
appearance of fatty 
liver; however, other liver disease including cirrhosis and 
fibrosis cannot be excluded. 
. 
MRCP to further evaluate cholecystitis: 
1.  Gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid 
consistent with 
cholecystitis. 
2.  No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation or 
pancreatic ductal dilatation. 
3.  Splenomegaly. 
4.  Moderate right pleural effusion and small amount of ascites. 

. 
ERCP: 
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left 
hepatic ducts, biliary radicles, cystic duct, and gallbladder 
were filled with contrast and well visualized. The course and 
caliber of the structures are normal with no evidence of 
extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no filling 
defects. Normal ERCP to the second part of duodenum. 
. 
BONE MARROW BIOPSY, for pancytopenia:  
1.     Hypercellular, erythroid dominant bone marrow with 
megaloblastoid erythropoiesis, left-shifted myelopoiesis, and 
megakaryocytic hyperplasia and dysplasia, see note.
Note:  The morphologic changes [megaloblastic erythropoiesis, 
dysplasia] are in keeping with a background HIV-related and/or 
treatment-related myelopathy. No lymphoma is noted.
2.     Small, non-necrotizing granulomata seen. 
Special stain for infectious organisms are pending and will be 
reported in an addendum.

BONE MARROW PATH REPORT ADDENDUM: 
AFB and GMS stains are negative for acid-fast and fungal 
organisms, respectively. Of note, the granulomas were no longer 
present on deeper levels obtained for stains. By 
immunohistochemistry, stain for CMV is negative. CD68 stains 
abundant interstitial histiocytes.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
55yo male with h/o AIDS (CD4 51, VL >100,000), HCV, multiple 
episodes of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4453**] initially in shock with presumed 
sepsis of biliary source, now with AFB in blood cultures and 
stool cultures, likely disseminated MAC  

# Disseminated MAC: High suspicion of MAC given constellation of 
diarrhea, fevers with night sweats, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, 
and pancytopenia with necrotizing granulomata on bone marrow in 
an AIDS patient who was not taking MAC prophylaxis. AFB in blood 
cultures from [**3-18**] and [**3-20**] and also in stool culture from [**3-23**]. 
Most likely MAC, less likely TB. Of note, smears of concentrated 
sputum samples were negative x3 therefore patient does not have 
infectious pulmonary tuberculosis. Started ethambutol 15mg/kg, 
rifabutin 150mg every other day (dose adjusted for concurrent 
ritonavir therapy, see below), and clarithromycin 500mg bid; 
will need prolonged course. Had opthalmologic exam on starting 
high dose ethambutol and will need follow-up monitoring of 
visual acuity and repeat optho exam in one month, as ethambutol 
can cause color blindness and decreased visual acuity; he has 
normal color vision and no visual complaints at the time of 
discharge. Had limited but apparently normal hearing test, but 
limited by impacted cerumen. Debrox otic drops x4 days and then 
repeat hearing test, as high dose clarithromycin can be ototoxic 
and patient will need long course.  
  
# Biliary disease: cholecystitis, either bacterial or 
acalculous, was aggressively pursued as source of sepsis, but 
after extensive workup including ERCP, findings were ultimately 
consistent with HIV cholangiopathy. During this work up, he did 
complete 10 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, most recently 
vancomycin and meropenem, empirically directed at biliary 
source. GI consultant additionally recommended EGD and 
colonoscopy because of mesenteric lymphadenopathy, which patient 
refused; once AFB cultures turned positive, consistent with MAC, 
further diagnostic procedures to evaluate this lymphadenopathy 
seemed redundant, although if it does not improve with MAC 
therapy, endoscopy should be re-considered. 

# HIV: CD4 count 51, viral load >100,000 copies (checked this 
admission); HIV genotype was sent to reference lab. Patient was 
not taking HAART on admission, but after discussing with Dr 
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4454**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 167**], patient's outpatient ID/Primary Care doctor, [**Hospital1 25**] 
ID consultant recommended initiating HAART while treatment for 
disseminated MAC was underway. Started Kaletra and lamivudine; 
ID initially recommended Kaletra + Truvada, but patient reported 
significant N/V with Truvada and refused to take it, so start 
with lamivudine for now; patient will follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 167**] 
and likely add another ARV to regimen. Atovaquone for PCP 
prophylaxis because it was possible that hemolysis observed 
during was due to dapsone and patient reports allergies to 
bactrim and pentamadine. 

# Pancytoenia: likely [**12-25**] disseminated MAC  
** Leukopenia: received Filgrastim with improvement in ANC 
levels twice weekly with adequate WBC response. Will continue 
with filgrastin 300mcg twice weekly x1 month; because MAC is 
slow to respond to antibiotics, may need longer course of GM-CSF 
support.   
** Anemia - stable at 24 (same as admission), low retic, 
elevated ferritin, low hapto. Course complicated by hemolysis in 
ICU, resolved after stopping dapsone but exact cause not 
certain, for which he received 3 units PRBCs.  
** low platelets - could be either PHAT (primary HIV-associated 
thrombocytopenia) or MAC infiltration of bone marrow. HIT Ab 
(low suspicion) was negative.   
 
# Tachycardia: CTA was negative for PE, possibly due to anemia; 
also, AIDS patients have been reported to have persistent 
tachycardia.  
  
# COPD:  
- nebs Q6H  
  
# Delirium: Patient very disoriented near end of ICU stay, but 
mental state cleared and had normal sensorium on the medical 
[**Hospital1 **]. Avoid benzos; low dose atypical antipsychotic only if 
needed. 
 
# Depression: patient seems depressed when talking to him, very 
frustrated with hospital stay and doesn't feel that he is 
getting any better. Appreciate psychiatry input.  
 
# Ascites: likely due to aggressive volume resuscitation early 
in ICU course. Patient refused paracentesis; after diagnosis of 
AFB bacteremia was established, thoracentesis was not likely to 
add additional diagnostic information, so this was not 
revisited. 

# bilateral pleural effusions: again, likely due to volume 
resuscitation; ICU team discussed diagnostic tap with patient, 
who refused procedure. Once unifying diagnosis of AFB 
bacteremia/disseminated MAC was made, this was not revisited. 
Once patient was ambulatory, effusions decreased somewhat in 
size with pulmonary toilet and he was weaned off oxygen 
gradually. 

#) code - DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient
#) FEN - received TPN for malnutrtion and [**Known patient lastname **] po intake while 
in ICU. Advanced to regular diet as tolerates, with Ensure 
supplements and Megace for AIDS wasting.  
#) proph - low platelets so pneumoboots only

When the ambulance arrived in patient's room, pt changed his mind of being transferred from ICU to another unit and insisted to go home. HO informed and the resident MD talked in length with the patient who still insisted to go home. Nursing supervisor ([**Doctor Last Name 1729**] [**Doctor First Name 1343**]) and the ICU resource nurse informed, then security was called and thereafter a code purple was made and a psychiatric consultant talked to pt. Prior to that, pt was given 2 mg Haldol IV, which calmed him down. After the psych. consultant spoke to pt, he verbalized that he will stay in the hospital. Resident MD informed and [**Hospital Ward Name 41**] 7 RN informed that pt is to be transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 41**] 7.
