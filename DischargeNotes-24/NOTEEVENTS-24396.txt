Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 556**] 
Chief Complaint:
X-fer from [**Hospital 770**] Hospital- COPD with RML PNA and RUL mass. 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT guided lung biopsy

 
History of Present Illness:
HPI Summary: 61 YO female with Hx of COPD- bullous predominantly 
in RUL that is transferred for a pulmonary second opinion and 
RML pneumonia.  
.  
In Spring 2005, pt developed a respiratory infection which was 
Tx with PO Antibiotic with mild resolution. However, she 
developed a reoccurence of a RML infiltrated. The Pt was 
admitted to the hospital for IV Antibiotics- Ceftriaxone and 
Gatifloxacin. The patient was discharged and was placed on 
Augmentin. She improved clinically and radiographically. The 
patient went on vacation in August and was doing well.  
.  
End of August, pt was fatigued and had a CBC which showed WBC of 
50K. The pt was referred to [**Hospital3 1722**] and a Bone Marrow Bx 
showed a reactive process and not consistent with an acute 
leukemia. The patient underwent a torso CT which showed 
increased size of pneumonitis in RML eventhough symptomatically 
was not worse. The pt was admitted to [**Hospital 770**] Hospital in 
middle september. After 3 days, the pt had an acute exacerbation 
and had to be intubated and was extubated after 2 days in the 
ICU. Pt was Tx with Zosyn and gatifloxacin since that time at a 
rehab center at the hospital. Sputum at OSH showed yeast forms, 
upper respiratory flora and a one sputum showed aspergillous.  
.  
CT scan after being Tx with Zosyn and gatifloxacin showed some 
improvement in the RML, but also had continued sever bullous 
emphysematous changes with chronic infiltrate with stable 
lymphadenopathy and now a patchy left lower lobe infiltrate with 
stable lymphadenopathy and a patchy left lower lobe infiltrate. 
In the bulla there appears to be an area suggesting a possible 
mass in one of her cavities which certainly could signify 
possibility of a mycetoma, aspergilloma, or neoptlams. Sputum 
cytologies and bronchosopies x2 at OSH have been negative.  
Note: Mycetoma- is a chronic, specific, granulomatous, 
progressive inflammatory disease; it usually involves the 
subcutaneous tissue after a traumatic inoculation of the 
causative organism. Mycetoma may be caused by true fungi or by 
higher bacteria and hence it is usually classified into 
eumycetoma and actinomycetoma respectively (1). Tumefaction and 
formation of sinus tracts characterize mycetoma. The sinuses 
usually discharge purulent and seropurulent exudate containing 
grains. It may spread to involve the skin and the deep 
structures resulting in destruction, deformity and loss of 
function, very occasionally it could be fatal.  
.  
 
Currently, the patient states she is resting comfortably. + mild 
dyspnea.  
Denies F/C, N/V, cough, sinus discharge, CP, SOB, abdominal 
pain, and urinary symptoms

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61 YO female with COPD and bullous changes x-ferred to 
[**Hospital1 25**] for further evaluation of her persistent RML 
pneumonia/pneumonitis and RUL mass.  
.  
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 25**] for further evaluation of the 
RUL mass by interventional pulmonology.  CT scans were repeated 
at [**Hospital1 25**] to better characterize the lesions (see results).  IP 
saw the patient; they biopsied and obtained tissue on [**10-31**], 
results showed aspergillus.  She was started on Voriconazole.  
The patient was oberved off antibiotics for several days (as 
felt to be fungal, not bacterial pathogen), whereupon she began 
spike high fevers and her WBC count slowly trended upward.  
Vanco and ceftaz were started for presumed bacterial 
superinfection, then broadened further to include meropenem.  C. 
diff was diagnosed, and flagyl was started.  Eventually, she had 
to be intubated due to respiratory failure.  In the MICU, she 
became septic.  Despite very aggressive antimicrobial and 
pulmonary treatments, her conditioned worsened.  After multiple 
family meetings discussing the very poor prognosis, the decision 
was made to prioritize comfort in her care.  She passed away on 
[**3326-11-13**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  61-year-old woman with history of bullous COPD and pneumonia,
     predominantly in the right upper and middle lobes.  Pneumonia not improved
     since Spring 2005.  The patient on antibiotics.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST.
     
     No comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MD CT of the chest was performed from the thoracic inlet through
     the adrenals without injection of intravenous contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is severe emphysema.  Emphysematous bullae are seen in both
     lungs, more on the right.  A few of these bullae in the right middle lobe and
     right lower lobe show nodular soft tissue opacities within, which are
     concerning for aspergilloma.  Areas of heterogeneous opacification are seen
     surrounding the emphysematous bullae in the right middle lobe and right lower
     lobe and another possibility could be necrotizing pneumonia.  The airways are
     patent up to the segmental bronchi.  There is mediastinal and hilar
     lymphadenopathy.  The largest precarinal node measures 13 mm.  There is no
     pleural or pericardial effusion.  Aortic valve calcification is noted.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the liver, spleen, adrenals, and
     kidneys are unremarkable.  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen in
     the bones.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  Severe bilateral emphysema with soft tissue nodules within multiple
     emphysematous bullae in the right middle lobe and lower lobe. Differential
     diagnosis includes aspergillomas and necrotizing pneumonia.
     
     2.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PROCEDURE:  CT-guided tissue sample / FNA  of lung mass.
     
     HISTORY:  61-year-old woman with COPD.  PNA has not improved on antibiotics.
     There are continued severe bullous emphysematous changes with chronic
     infiltrate, stable patchy infiltrate throughout the lung with an area
     suggesting possible mass in one of the cavities.
     
     Comparison is made with prior study dated [**3326-10-27**].
     
     CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There have been no changes in the severe
     emphysematous changes and bullae throughout both lungs.  A cavitation in the
     upper right lobe was chosen to be sampled.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The advantage and complications of the procedure were explained to
     the patient.  Written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was prepped
     and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was called to
     confirm the identity of the patient.
     
     Under fluoro CT guidance and following the administration of Marcaine as local
     anesthesia, a 22-gauge  needle was advanced via  superior posterior right
     intercostal approach, using this an FNA was attempted obtained initially a
     small amount of tissue. Following this, 5 cc of saline was flushed into the
     cavity and then aspirated, obtaining more specimen (solid material) , samples
     were also obtained from the edges of the lesions.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     Chest x-ray was requested two hours post-procedure.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Successful tissue sample/FNA of lung cavity.
     
     Samples were sent for microbiology and pathology.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PROCEDURE:  CT-guided tissue sample / FNA  of lung mass.
     
     HISTORY:  61-year-old woman with COPD.  PNA has not improved on antibiotics.
     There are continued severe bullous emphysematous changes with chronic
     infiltrate, stable patchy infiltrate throughout the lung with an area
     suggesting possible mass in one of the cavities.
     
     Comparison is made with prior study dated [**3326-10-27**].
     
     CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There have been no changes in the severe
     emphysematous changes and bullae throughout both lungs.  A cavitation in the
     upper right lobe was chosen to be sampled.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The advantage and complications of the procedure were explained to
     the patient.  Written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was prepped
     and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was called to
     confirm the identity of the patient.
     
     Under fluoro CT guidance and following the administration of Marcaine as local
     anesthesia, a 22-gauge  needle was advanced via  superior posterior right
     intercostal approach, using this an FNA was attempted obtained initially a
     small amount of tissue. Following this, 5 cc of saline was flushed into the
     cavity and then aspirated, obtaining more specimen (solid material) , samples
     were also obtained from the edges of the lesions.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     Chest x-ray was requested two hours post-procedure.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Successful tissue sample/FNA of lung cavity.
     
     Samples were sent for microbiology and pathology.

     COMPARISON:  Head CT scan from [**3326-11-3**].
     
     CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no acute intracranial
     hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or major
     vascular territorial infarction. Small areas of cerebral white matter
     hypodensity are stable. On post- contrast images, there is a vague 4- mm area
     of enhancement in the subcortical white matter of the medial anterior left
     frontal lobe.  A small vessel is seen coursing adjacent to this area of
     enhancement, and this may be a vascular structure. Ther is no assocaited
     edema. There is minor opacification of a single posterior right ethmoid air
     cell. Remaining paranasal sinuses are clear.  There is no pneumatization of
     the frontal sinus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Questionable 4-mm ovoid area of enhancement in the left frontal
     lobe.  The differential diagnosis includes a vascular structure or

     MR HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**3326-11-7**]
     
     HISTORY:  Aspergillosis and headaches.  Possible left frontal enhancing lesion
     on CT scan.
     
     Sagittal and axial short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was performed through
     the brain.  Axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo,
     FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion technique.  Three-dimensional
     time-of-flight MR arteriography was performed.  After administration of
     gadolinium intravenous contrast, axial and coronal short TR, short TE spin
     echo imaging was performed.  Comparison to a brain CT of [**3326-11-5**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The small focus of enhancement in the left frontal lobe identified
     on the prior CT examination is not demonstrated on the current study.  In
     retrospect, this likely represented a loop of a vessel in the depth of a
     sulcus.  The post-contrast axial and the coronal short TR images cover this
     area thoroughly and there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement.  The
     ventricles and the sulci appear normal in caliber and configuration.  There is
     marked hyperintensity in the central pons.  If there is no clinical history to
     suggest prior osmotic demyelination, this most likely represents chronic small
     vessel ischemia.  There are numerous areas of high signal intensity in the
     periventricular and the subcortical white matter that also suggest chronic
     small vessel ischemia.  There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast
     administration.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No evidence of abscess.

     scan likely represented a looping vessel in a sulcus.

     INDICATION:  61-year-old woman status post CT-guided lung biopsy, growing
     aspergilloma.
     
     COMMENTS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are reviewed, and compared
     with previous study of [**3326-10-31**].
     
     The patient has underlying severe pulmonary emphysema.  Again note is made of
     a cavity with thickened wall and air-fluid levels in the right upper lobe. 
     These findings are consistent with patient's diagnosis of Aspergillus
     infection.  The degree of the cavitary lesion and air-fluid levels have
     increased compared with the previous study.
     
     No pneumothorax is identified.  The heart is normal in size.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Severe pulmonary emphysema.
     2.  Worsening cavitary lesion with thickened wall and air-fluid levels in the
     right upper lobe as described above.

     HISTORY:  Aspergilloma.  Shortness of breath following blood transfusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-7**] and [**10-30**] and 27:
     
     There has been a decrease in the volume of fluid which collected in the large
     bullae of the right upper lobe and perhaps superior segment of the right lower
     lobe between [**10-31**] and [**11-7**].  This was presumably hemorrhage or pus
     and presumably has been partially expectorated since [**11-7**].  In addition
     to severe emphysema, there is a mild interstitial abnormality most pronounced
     in the left lower lobe which is unchanged since [**10-30**] and therefore not
     attributable to acute edema, cardiac or otherwise.  There is no pneumothorax.
     Heart size is normal and mediastinal position shifted slightly to the right
     superiorly and to the left inferiorly is not changed.
