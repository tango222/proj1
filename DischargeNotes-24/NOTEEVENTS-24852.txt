Decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally
Heart rate regular
Abdomen mildly distended and tympanitic.  Right upper and lower 
quadrant tenderness to mild palpation with guarding.  
Rectal exam with normal tone, brown, trace heme-positive stool.
 
Pertinent Results:
[**5-17**] RUQ U/S: Findings most consistent with acute cholecystitis, 
as discussed with General Surgery houseofficer, and posted to 
the ED dashboard, at the time of dictation

[**5-17**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1. Inflammatory process involving the 
right upper abdomen as described, which appears more likely 
centered on a distended gallbladder with sludge and stones, 
rather than on the ascending colonic diverticula, though there 
is a spastic-appearing colonic segment in the vicinity.
2. Evidence of chronic pancreatitis with calcifications and 
atrophy.
3. No evidence of inflammatory process in the right lower 
abdomen.
4. Extensive vascular calcification with no aneurysms seen.
5. Small-moderate right pleural effusion with basilar 
atelectasis.

[**5-19**] Cholecystostomy: Successful ultrasound-guided percutaneous 
cholecystostomy tube placement. 200 cc of bilious fluid was 
aspirated, a portion which was sent for microbiology.

[**5-20**] RUQ U/S: Large biloma in gallbladder fossa with 
decompressed gallbladder with thickened, ruptured wall. Findings 
including possible percutaneous drainage of the biloma were 
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at completion of 
examination

[**5-20**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.Compared to prior CT from [**2704-5-17**], 
there is increased eccentric fluid collection adjacent to the 
anterolateral aspect of the gallbladder fundus with marked 
pericholeycstic stranding, concerning for rupture. In addition, 
since the prior exam, the patient has developed increased 
peripancreatic stranding, which may be related to the 
gallbladder, however, an acute pancreatitis cannot be entirely 
excluded. No pancreatic ductal dilatation or stone within the 
duct is identified. Recommend correlation with pancreatic 
enzymes.
2. Bilateral ground-glass opacity and pleural effusion with an 
area of consolidation within the right lung base. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6171**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 25**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 
and cared for in the Trauma SICU.  He and his wife initially 
declined surgery and cholecystostomy tube; he ultimately did 
receive cholecystostomy tube once his status declined.   This 
was performed on HD3.  He became anuric with an elevated lactate 
after placement of this drain, receiving 8 L of IV fluids, and 
forming only 500 cc of urine despite lasix.  His blood pressure 
dropped, and he required increasing amounts of Levophed.  He was 
then intubated for increased work of breathing.  On HD4, Mr. 
[**Known patient lastname 6171**] was brought ot the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an 
exploratory laparotomy, cholecystectomy, and hemodialysis line 
placement.  Details of this procedure may be found in his 
operative note.  Postoperatively, he became hypotensive and 
developed pulseless electrical activity.  After 60 minutes of 
resuscitation, he recovered a perfusing rhythm.  The patient's 
family was notified, and the decision was made to change his 
code status to DNR.  At 1802, his code status was changed to 
CMO, and he soon expired after pharmacologic supports were 
withdrawn.

      88 year old man with acute cholecystitis                                        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for pulmonary edema

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Rule out pulmonary edema.  Current acute cholecystitis.
     
     COMPARISON:  Last available chest radiograph from [**2702-12-5**] had shown
     small bibasilar pleural effusions.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  A portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained in
     semi-upright position.
     
     Low lung volumes, with subsequent widening of the cardiomediastinal
     silhouette.  Aortic calcifications and bibasilar pleural effusion are again
     noted.  Subsegmental atelectasis is suspected in the retrocardiac region,
     however without silhouetting adjacent to the hemidiaphragm.  No major
     pulmonary edema is seen in these conditions.  Residual contrast material is
     seen in the greater tuberosity of the stomach.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Technically limited study given low lung volumes.  No obvious,
     major pulmonary edema detected in these conditions.

     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2704-5-17**]:
     
     HISTORY:  88-year-old man with right-sided abdominal pain x 3 days and firm
     abdomen; ? diverticulitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Routine [**Hospital1 550**] unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis with
     multidetector helical 5-mm axial sections from the lung bases through the
     pubic symphysis following oral contrast administration and coronal and
     sagittal reformations.  Note that, apparently, the oral contrast preparation
     was initiated at the [**Location (un) 6700**] Campus, and that the contrast column only
     reaches the mid-small bowel.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are numerous diverticula throughout the large bowel,
     including the hepatic flexure and ascending colon.  In this region, there is
     an apparent ""spastic"" segment of ascending colon, containing numerous
     diverticula, with immediately adjacent fat-stranding (2:27-44).  However,
     there is no single ""culprit"" diverticulum and the inflammatory fat-stranding
     extends cephalad to surround the distended gallbladder, on both sides.  The
     gallbladder measures up to 11.9 cm, longitudinally, and contains layering
     sludge and numerous small calculi.  There is no appreciable gallbladder mural
     thickening and only an apparent thin sliver of pericholecystic fluid, though
     evaluation of these findings is limited on this non-enhanced examination.
     There is no definite intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and
     the pancreas is notable for numerous parenchymal calcifications and some fatty
     atrophy, without ductal dilatation or discrete mass.  There is a small amount
     of ascites, anterior to the liver, which is otherwise unremarkable in
     appearance. The spleen is normal in caliber and contour.  There is no evidence
     of inflammatory process elsewhere in the abdomen, particularly in the right
     lower abdomen, though the appendix is not definitely identified.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     The remainder of the examination is notable for extensive, confluent
     atherosclerotic calcification and tortuosity of the abdominal aorta and its
     branches, with no frank aneurysm.  Incidentally noted are extensive
     degenerative changes involving the lumbosacral spine, as well as prostatic
     calcifications.  There is a small-moderate right pleural effusion with
     associated relaxation atelectasis, and a solitary punctate diaphragmatic
     pleural calcification.  There is apparent left ventricular enlargement and
     extensive coronary arterial calcification.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     ULTRASOUND OF THE RIGHT UPPER ABDOMEN DATED [**2704-5-17**]
     
     HISTORY:  88-year-old man with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and
     enlarged gallbladder by CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Realtime sonography of the right upper abdomen with Doppler
     interrogation was performed in emergency radiology.  The study is compared
     with the CT examination obtained some 75 minutes earlier.  As on that study,
     the gallbladder is distended and contains abundant layering sludge with
     shadowing gallstones.  There is apparent slight circumferential mural
     thickening, measuring up to 3.3 mm at the fundus, with no definite
     pericholecystic fluid.  There is reportedly a positive sonographic [**Doctor Last Name 104**]
     sign (despite the patient's having received Morphine).  There is no
     intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and the common bile duct measures 3.9
     mm in the porta hepatis.  No focal hepatic lesion or definite ascites is
     identified. The main portal vein is normal in caliber and demonstrates normal
     hepatopetal flow and phasic respiratory variation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with acute cholecystitis, as discussed
     with General Surgery houseofficer, and posted to the ED dashboard, at the time
     of dictation.

     EXAMINATION:  Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy placement dated
     [**2704-5-19**].
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal ultrasound, [**2704-5-17**].
     
     INDICATION:  88-year-old male with acute cholecystitis who declined surgery.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was explained to the patient along with risks and
     benefits, and written informed consent was obtained.  Specifically, the risk
     of hemorrhage was discussed with the patient, given his history taking aspirin
     and Plavix which were stopped three days ago.  In addition, the patient was
     transfused with six packs of platelets one-and-half hours before the
     procedure.  A pre-procedural timeout was performed to confirm the patient's
     identity, site of procedure, and type of procedure using two patient
     identifiers.  Ultrasonography was used to mark an appropriate spot to
     percutaneously access the gallbladder transhepatically.  The patient's skin
     was marked and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Approximately
     15 cc of buffered lidocaine was used to provide local anesthesia.  Then, under
     ultrasound guidance, an 8 French pigtail catheter was advanced
     transhepatically into the gallbladder.  Position was confirmed, and the
     catheter was advanced.  The pigtail was formed.  Approximately 200 cc of
     bilious fluid was aspirated.  The catheter was connected to a drainage bag.
     During the procedure, the IV team provided conscious sedation.  The patient
     tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure
     complications.
     
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 651**], attending radiologist, was present throughout the entire procedure
     and supervised the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube
     placement.  200 cc of bilious fluid was aspirated, a portion which was sent
     for microbiology.

     COMPARISON:  [**2704-5-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis
     from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The lung bases demonstrate
     bilateral ground-glass opacity, and a more focal area of consolidation in the
     posterior right lung base.  Atelectasis is seen within the left lung base.
     Limited views of the heart demonstrate calcification within the coronaries and
     aortic root.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, right greater left.
     
     Compared to prior CT from three days prior, there is increased perihepatic
     fluid with eccentric fluid collection anterolateral to the gallbladder fundus
     and marked pericholecystic stranding, as well as generalized stranding within
     the abdomen,  concerning for a rupture of the gallbladder. Again identified is
     numerous stones and sludge within the gallbladder. A percutaneous
     cholecystotomy tube appears in good position. Multiple punctate calcifications
     are seen in a somwwhat atrophic pancreas, consistent with chronic
     pancreatitis. In addition, there is increased peripancreatic stranding, for
     which acute pancreatitis cannot be excluded. No pancreatic ductal dilatation
     or stone is identified. Correlation with pancreatic enzymes is recommended.
     The spleen, kidneys, adrenal g1ands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel
     are unremarkable. Extensive colonic and sigmoid diverticulosis is again
     demonstrated
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum, prostate, and
     seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  A Foley catheter is seen within the
     bladder.  Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are identified.  No pelvic
     free fluid or free air is identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Extensive degenerative changes are seen throughout the
     thoracolumbar spine with multilevel disc space narrowing and endplate
     sclerosis.

     COMPARISON:  [**2704-5-20**] at 1:57 p.m.
     
     CHEST AP:  Since the exam of two hours earlier, there has been placement of
     bilateral chest tubes.  The right pleural effusion has decreased in size.  No
     pneumothorax is identified.  The remaining lines and tubes are in unchanged
     position.  Diffusely increased interstitial opacities and Kerley B lines are
     consistent with pulmonary edema.  There is right lower lobe atelectasis. 
     Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Development of moderate pulmonary edema.
     2.  Status post placement of bilateral chest tubes with decrease in right
     pleural effusion and no evidence of pneumothorax.

     COMPARISON:  Percutaneous cholecystostomy placement [**2704-5-19**] and CT
     abdomen and pelvis [**2704-5-20**].
     
     INDICATION:  88-year-old male with cholecystostomy tube new onset sepsis,
     reevaluation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Limited ultrasound view of the right upper quadrant demonstrates a
     large fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa which measures 9 cm x 8 cm
     suggestive of biloma.  Imaging reveals a decompressed gallbladder with
     thickened wall.  The percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was in appropriate
     position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large biloma in gallbladder fossa  with decompressed gallbladder
     with thickened, ruptured wall.  Findings including possible percutaneous
     drainage of the biloma were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 124**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1448**] at

     INDICATION:  Hypotension requiring pressors, poor ejection fraction, right
     subclavian line placement.
     
     CHEST, ONE VIEW:  Comparison with multiple previous examinations, the most
     recent of which is [**2704-5-19**].  An endotracheal tube has been placed with
     its tip approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  A new right subclavian line is
     seen with its tip at the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is present. The right
     lung is better aerated than the last examination, but the right pleural
     effusion is probably similar in size.  Right pulmonary vessels are slightly
     more engorged on the left, reflecting development of asymmetric pulmonary
     edema.  The left lung appears relatively clear, without sizeable pleural
     effusion.

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 88-year-old male with percutaneous cholecystostomy tube
     placement, now with  presssor fluid dependence.  Evaluate for hematoma or
     intraperitoneal bleeding. 
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2704-5-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis
     from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The lung bases demonstrate
     bilateral ground-glass opacity, and a more focal area of consolidation in the
     posterior right lung base.  Atelectasis is seen within the left lung base.
     Limited views of the heart demonstrate calcification within the coronaries and
     aortic root.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, right greater left.
     
     Compared to prior CT from three days prior, there is increased perihepatic
     fluid with eccentric fluid collection anterolateral to the gallbladder fundus
     and marked pericholecystic stranding, as well as generalized stranding within
     the abdomen,  concerning for a rupture of the gallbladder. Again identified is
     numerous stones and sludge within the gallbladder. A percutaneous
     cholecystotomy tube appears in good position. Multiple punctate calcifications
     are seen in a somwwhat atrophic pancreas, consistent with chronic
     pancreatitis. In addition, there is increased peripancreatic stranding, for
     which acute pancreatitis cannot be excluded. No pancreatic ductal dilatation
     or stone is identified. Correlation with pancreatic enzymes is recommended.
     The spleen, kidneys, adrenal g1ands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel
     are unremarkable. Extensive colonic and sigmoid diverticulosis is again
     demonstrated
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum, prostate, and
     seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  A Foley catheter is seen within the
     bladder.  Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are identified.  No pelvic
     free fluid or free air is identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Extensive degenerative changes are seen throughout the
     thoracolumbar spine with multilevel disc space narrowing and endplate
     sclerosis.  
                                                                 (Over)

Pt went to OR @ 0800 and returned @ 1145 s/p cholesystectomy. Pt was sedated with vital signs steady(see careview) and lab work in line with pre-op values; temp was 37.5 C. He continued on levophed support @ 0.18mcg/kg/min.  PA and Quinton catheters were placed in OR. Pt was settled and family memebers visited for about 45 minutes after speaking with attending surgeon and surgical and ICU residents.
Plan was to initiate CVVHD therapy for fluid removal and dialysis; this was initiated @ 1430. At about 1437 pt was noted to become tachycardic to 130 range; blood pressure drifted less than 100/systolic to 66/systolic. Fluid and increased levophed dose were administered. Pt proceded to EMD with flat BP and filling pressures: CPR was initiated. Resuccitation measures were continued for about one hour with multiple pharmacologic agents provided and defibrillation 8 times over the hour were administered. Pt was stabilized with levophed at 1mcg/kg/min and amioderone @ 1mg/kg/min. CVVHD was terminated earlier as arrest situation proceeded.
Family was called back to hospital; they spoke with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2282**] about patient's condition and grave situation. The decision to cahnge patient's code status to DNR was made. The family spent the following 2 hours at the patient's bedside and were witness to patients ongoing deterioration and the aggressive measures that were being provided to sustain him.( additional fluid and packed red cells x2 units; medications for ongoing acidemia, and warming measures for falling core temperature.) The family made the decision to stop aggresive therapy and let patient be comfortable. At 1802, all pharmacologic supports were suspended; fio2 was reduced to room air; versed and fentanyl infusions were increased. At 1812(per room clock); patient had no heart or blood pressure signs. ICU resident examed patient and confirmed time of death. Patient's family spent some time saying good-by. Resucitation form has been filled out and is awaiting Dr[**Location (un) 5143**] (attending in charge of code) signature.
