     INDICATION:  Evaluate debridement results.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There has been surgical removal of the majority of the first digit with only
     the proximal metatarsal head preserved.  Soft tissue defect is evident. There
     is a slight haziness at the distal margin of the remnant metatarsal bone, but
     no frank destructive features.  Please note that the fine detail is obscured
     by the overlying bandages and securing materials.  No other abnormalities are
     seen in the bones.  Calcified vessels are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Suggestion of slight indistinct margin at the resection site of the first
     metatarsal - osteomyelitis is possible.  Study limited by densities projecting
     on to the area of interest from overlying materials.

     HISTORY: 44-year-old man with history of prior right first ray amputation and
     peripheral vascular disease. Evaluation of possibilities of revascularization.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2274**] [**Name (STitle) 2275**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2253**]
     [**Name (STitle) 188**] d'Othee, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 188**] [**Name (STitle) 189**], attending radiologist present and
     supervising for the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: After obtaining written informed consent, the patient was
     placed supine on the angiographic table. The right groin was prepped and
     draped in standard sterile fashion. A pre-procedure timeout was performed.
     Using fluoroscopic guidance, the right common femoral artery was accessed with
     a 19-gauge needle, and an 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 108**] wire was advanced through the needle
     into the abdominal aorta.
     
     A 4-French multihole straight catheter was then advanced over the wire and
     exchanged for the needle into the abdominal aorta. The wire was removed,
     contrast was injected to confirm appropriate positioning of the catheter. An
     initial aortogram was performed which demonstrated normal aorta and bilateral
     iliac arteries.
     
     The catheter was then withdrawn into the lower abdominal aorta, and a pelvic
     arteriogram performed which demonstrated patent internal and external iliac
     arteries on the right.
     
     The catheter was then withdrawn into the right common femoral artery, and
     sequential arteriogram of the right lower extremity was performed. This
     demonstrated an approximately 5-10 cm long, significant stenosis of the right
     superficial femoral artery in the proximal thigh. Extensive wall calcification
     consistent with mediacalcinosis is seen along most of the right superficial
     femoral artery, along with an additional short focal stenosis in the distal
     right superficial femoral artery. The popliteal artery is patent.
     A significant short focal stenosis is seen at the level of right tibioperoneal
     trunk. Both the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries are patent
     proximally, however, appear diminutive in the distal leg. The main calf runoff
     is through the right peroneal artery which is patent up to the ankle.
     Arteriograms of the foot do not demonstrate the dorsalis pedis artery. A

     Following the procedure, the patient was transferred to the recovery area
     where the catheter was removed, and manual pressure applied to the right groin
     until adequate hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.

     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2274**] [**Name (STitle) 2275**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2253**]
     [**Name (STitle) 188**] d'Othee, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 188**] [**Name (STitle) 189**], attending radiologist present and
     supervising for the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: After obtaining written informed consent, the patient was
     placed supine on the angiographic table. The right groin was prepped and
     draped in standard sterile fashion. A pre-procedure timeout was performed.
     Using fluoroscopic guidance, the right common femoral artery was accessed with
     a 19-gauge needle, and an 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 108**] wire was advanced through the needle
     into the abdominal aorta.
     
     A 4-French multihole straight catheter was then advanced over the wire and
     exchanged for the needle into the abdominal aorta. The wire was removed,
     contrast was injected to confirm appropriate positioning of the catheter. An
     initial aortogram was performed which demonstrated normal aorta and bilateral
     iliac arteries.
     
     The catheter was then withdrawn into the lower abdominal aorta, and a pelvic
     arteriogram performed which demonstrated patent internal and external iliac
     arteries on the right.
     
     The catheter was then withdrawn into the right common femoral artery, and
     sequential arteriogram of the right lower extremity was performed. This
     demonstrated an approximately 5-10 cm long, significant stenosis of the right
     superficial femoral artery in the proximal thigh. Extensive wall calcification
     consistent with mediacalcinosis is seen along most of the right superficial
     femoral artery, along with an additional short focal stenosis in the distal
     right superficial femoral artery. The popliteal artery is patent.
     A significant short focal stenosis is seen at the level of right tibioperoneal
     trunk. Both the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries are patent
     proximally, however, appear diminutive in the distal leg. The main calf runoff
     is through the right peroneal artery which is patent up to the ankle.
     Arteriograms of the foot do not demonstrate the dorsalis pedis artery. A

     REASON:  The patient in need of bypass graft.
     
     STUDY #2:  Arterial Doppler, lower extremity.
     
     REASON:  Right foot ulcer.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both greater saphenous veins.
     They are patent.  On the right, the vein diameter ranges from 0.29-0.64 from
     the ankle to the groin.  On the left, the diameter ranges from 0.33-0.55 cm.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins with suitable diameters.
     Of note, the greater saphenous vein on the left is very superficial at the
     level of the knee down through the calf.  This is also noted to a lesser
     degree on the right.
     
     ARTERIAL DOPPLER, LOWER EXTREMITY:  On the right, Doppler tracings are
     monophasic at all levels from the femoral to the dorsalis pedis artery.  The
     ankle-brachial index cannot be calculated due to noncompressible vessels.
     Pulse volume recordings are dampened at the low thigh level and are flat line
     at the metatarsals.
     
     On the left, Doppler tracings are triphasic at the femoral and popliteal
     levels only.  They are monophasic below.  There is no ankle-brachial index.
     Pulse volume recordings show some drop off at the calf level and approximately
     11 mm at the metatarsals.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Significant right iliac and likely multisegmental disease on the
     right.  On the left, there is moderate tibial artery occlusive disease.

     INDICATION:  44-year-old male with right foot ulcer.  Please perform pulse
     volume recordings at the metatarsal level.
     
     COMPARISON:  Lower extremity noninvasive arterial studies from [**3427-4-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  Focal pulse volume recordings were obtained,
     revealing amplitudes of 26 mm at the right ankle and 6 mm at the right
     metatarsum with amplitudes of 14 mm at the left ankle and 9 mm at the left
     metatarsum.  Compared with the previous study dated in [**3427-4-10**], there is
     no significant change within the left lower extremity recordings.  On the
     right; however, the amplitude at the ankle has improved from a previous
     measurement of 8 mm and at the metatarsum from a previous measurement of 3 mm.
     There is dampening of the right metatarsal level waveform, but it is no longer
     flat lined.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Focused distal lower extremity pulse volume recordings, with
     amplitudes as stated above.  Compared with the previous study dated in [**3427-4-10**], there is moderate improvement on the right while the distal left
     extremity remains unchanged.

at [**Hospital1 25**]. He was d/c'd to [**Hospital **] Rehab for 1 week, where starting 
several days PTA he began c/o increased urinary frequency and 
urgency x several days, but unclear if he produced urine.  Then 
2d PTA had an episode of CP, SOB, diaphoresis, occasional 
jerking movements of his extremities and fasciculations of his 
abdominal muscles in context of elevated BP post-HD, which 
resolved spontaneously. On the day PTA, pt again had jerking 
movements, became increasingly confused, prompting his wife to 
bring him to the [**Hospital6 4436**] ED. In the OSH, he was 
noted to be ""writhing,"" which decreased with ativan x 5 mg. Also 
received one dose of levofloxacin for presumed UTI, and blood cx 
was sent. Had a negative head CT at OSH. Because of hypertension 
to SBP 220s, he was started on his home agents, then changed to 
nitroprusside. He was also started on insulin gtt for elevated 
fsbg in 300s. Patient was intubated to protect airway, then 
transferred to [**Hospital1 25**] MICU at family's request.

IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly and mild congestive heart failure versus volume 
overload. Stable right pleural effusion.
2. Right-sided PICC with tip in mid SVC.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3427-5-21**] 1:37 PM
IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema, which may be due to 
volume overload in this patient with history of end-stage renal 
disease. 

FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT  [**3427-5-20**] 11:06 AM
IMPRESSION: Simple fluid collection within the right groin.

CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**3427-5-19**] 9:17 PM
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 4.4 x 4.5 cm low-density rounded lesion within the 
right inguinal region. This could represent a pseudoaneurysm or 
a mass, however, as contrast was not administered, its 
enhancement characteristics cannot be determined. Superinfection 
of the lesion cannot be excluded. An ultrasound of this mass is 
recommended. 

ECG Study date [**3427-5-18**]  5:29:48 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular 
block. Left ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave 
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**3427-5-13**] left axis 
deviation is now present.

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**3427-5-18**] 
IMPRESSION: This is a moderately abnormal EEG due to the 
presence of 
bifrontal and widespread slowing superimposed upon a slow 
background. 
This pattern is most consistent with a mild to moderate 
encephalopathy 
of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. The technologist did 
not note 
any episodes of unusual movements, and no evidence for ongoing 
seizures 
was seen. 
  
[**3427-5-14**] Radiology ART DUP EXT UP UNI LMTD RIGHT   IMPRESSION: 
1. Mild fusiform enlargement of the proximal portion of the 
right subclavian artery, corresponding to a diameter of 150 per 
cent as compared to the contralateral side. This corresponds to 
a borderline value for the definition of an aneurysm. No mural 
thrombus is seen. 
2. Incidental note of the presence of a PICC line in the right 
subclavian vein.

[**3427-5-13**] Cardiology ECG Sinus rhythm 
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave 
abnormalities 
Since previous tracing of [**3427-5-7**], baseline artifact seen 

[**3427-5-13**] Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is a normal 
routine EEG obtained in wakefulness and brief stage II [**Doctor Last Name 209**]. No 
lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen. 
  
[**3427-5-11**] Radiology MR HEAD INTERPRETATION: Limited examination 
due to motion artifact. No intracranial masses visualized. No 
acute stroke is seen. Few foci of increased T2 signal in the 
periventricular white matter which may be related to chronic 
hypertension versus chronic microvascular ischemic changes. 
Opacification of both mastoid air cells.
INTERPRETATION: MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 337**] within 
normal limits.

[**3427-5-11**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)   IMPRESSION: Normalization 
of chest findings. Good position of right-sided PICC line.

[**3427-5-8**] Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: Possibly normal EEG 
with an excessively drowsy record overall possibly suggestive of 
[**Doctor Last Name 209**] deprivation or an early encephalopathy. 

[**3427-5-7**] Cardiology ECG Sinus rhythm Left ventricular 
hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities Clinical correlation is 
suggested Since previous tracing of [**3427-4-24**], QRS voltage and 
ST-T wave changes more prominent 

[**3427-5-7**] Cardiology ECHO 1. The left atrium is moderately 
dilated. The left atrium is elongated. 2. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular  
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal(LVEF>55%).  3. Right ventricular chamber size 
is normal. Right ventricular systolic  function is normal.  
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses 
or vegetations are seen on  the aortic valve.  5.The mitral 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mass or vegetation 
is  seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen.  6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal.  7. There is no pericardial effusion.  

[**3427-5-7**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   IMPRESSION:
1) Increasing opacity in left retrocardiac region, which may be 
due to aspiration, atelectasis or evolving infectious pneumonia.
2) Possible mild fluid overload

[**3427-5-6**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   IMPRESSION:
Low position of endotracheal tube, terminating in the proximal 
right main stem bronchus. This finding has been communicated 
with the clinical service caring for the patient. Subtle 
increased opacity in left retrocardiac region, which may be due 
to atelectasis, aspiration or early pneumonia. Followup 
radiograph suggested.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
44 yo M w/ DM1, HTN, ESRD on HD, p/w delta ms x2d and marked 
fever x 1d.
.
MICU course:
After arriving at [**Hospital1 25**], patient had CXR that was clear, though 
RN did suction vomitus out of ETT. Also had head CT that was 
negative for bleed or mass, EKG with peaked T waves but no 
ischemic changes, serum tox negative. Was started on 
CTX/Acyclovir IV in case of meningitis, then had an LP performed 
with no evid of infection, cultures negative, was put on 
acyclovir until HSV PCR came back negative. Had a TTE to look 
for vegetations that was negative, does have LVH. Was also 
switched from nitroprusside gtt to labetolol gtt for blood 
pressure control, thiocyante level was sent out of concern for 
cyanide toxicity given his ESRD. Repeat CXR showed increasing 
opacity in the left retrocardiac region, concerning for 
pneumonia. Blood, urine, CSF cultures were without growth. 
Sputum culture c/w OP flora. Did have WBC count 19 with left 
shift, which came down to 11. Prior to transfer to floor, was 
followed by Renal who feel that symptoms on admit were likely 
from hypertensive urgency, and Neuro who feel that symptoms were 
c/w sz d/o (partial complex status epilepticus), recommended 
dilantin loading, EEG that was consistent with encephalopathy 
but without sz activity. 
.
Floor course:
1. Delta ms: 
-was likely multifactorial, including some element from HTN, 
dilantin side effect as free dilantin levels were markedly 
elevated with %bound dilantin around 55%, possible postictal 
state. HTN was intermittently brought under control but with 
continued encephalopathy. Nitroprusside use was concerning for 
cyanide toxicity, thiocyanate level sent was wnl. Nipride used 
in ICU as outside hospital. Dilantin dosing was being done 
initially based on bound levels, but then once free phenytoin 
came back it became apparent that he was seeing much higher free 
levels than predicted. Dilantin was discontinued in favor of 
Trileptal. Though no sz activity was caught on EEG, it was 
thought that the story of his presenting symptoms were likely 
possibly from a postictal state. Patient's symptoms slowly 
improved, most notably after discontinuing the Dilantin, though 
it is hard to say for sure what the biggest factor was in his 
delirium. He returned to baseline before discharge. He did have 
a second episode of encephalopathy during the later part of the 
hospitalization when the patient again became febrile.  It 
should be noted that on initial presentation the patient was 
also febrile so the second episode of fever/delerium may have 
[**Doctor First Name **] caused by the same factor as the first.  This would suggest 
that the first episode of delerium was not due to a seizure.
.
2. Fever: Had fever on admit, no clear source found, resolved 
shortly thereafter.
Had urinary sx on admit as well, with elevated WBC count and 
bandemia concerning for UTI; patient was anuric except for 
straight cath specimen that was overwhelmed with blood from the 
straight cath itself most likely. His symptoms resolved after 
antibiotics were given in MICU. His CXR was initially clear, but 
had some evidence of PNA on repeat and RN suctioned same 
material out of ETT that was vomited. Follow up chest x-ray was 
markedly improved . TTE was negative for vegetation. He had 
recurrent fever on [**5-18**] and was pan-cultured with no obvious 
source found. An ID consult was obtained and it was thought that 
he most likely had a bacteremia that was not caught on culture. 
They recommended a 2 week course of Vancomycin and Levoquin for 
presumed occult bacteremia.
 
3. HTN: extremely difficult to control; was on nitroprusside 
initially then labetalol drip while in MICU. Subsequently 
started on clonidine and ramped up, ramped up lisinopril, then 
minoxidil that was ramped up, finally controlling his BP 
somewhat. Will need further outpatient management. Patient's 
lack of insight into diet is also limiting in this regard. It 
seems likely the patient's hypertension is in large part volume 
dependent as his interdialyctic weight would often increase by 
as much as 6kg. Per conversation with the patient's outpatient 
nephrologist, this has been an ongoing issue.
.
4. ESRD: continued HD MWF, renal team followed closely and 
challenged dry weight; continued procrit as BP allowed (held 
when BP too high). 
.
5. Anemia: stool found to be guaiac positive and because of 
unexplained hematocrit drop he underwent an endoscopy and 
colonoscopy which revealed gastritis and a polyp (latter was 
biopsied- results pending at the time of this summary). Although 
this was not likely to cause the drop in HCT, the patient was 
transfused and his HCT  remains stable to date. 

6. DM1: was initially kept on lower dose of glargine in setting 
of poor PO intake, but then glargine was titrated back up in the 
setting of hyperglycemia and dietary indiscretion. [**Last Name (un) 279**] was 
consulted to help manage this patient. His blood sugars were 
better controlled on discharge, though he will need [**Last Name (un) 279**] f/u 
as an outpatient to manage his brittle diabetes.
.
7. H/o sz: EEG#1 had enceph, no sx; EEG#2 was normal; was on 
dilantin initially, switched to trileptal because levels were 
running high; will f/u with Neuro as outpatient. It should be 
noted that it is unclear whether any of the patient's episodes 
of delerium could be attributed to seziure activity.

     Comparison is made to previous study of [**3427-5-6**].
     
     An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place.  The nasogastric
     tube is now coiled with the distal tip directed back towards the GE junction
     region.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina
     with the neck in a flexed position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     stable.  There has been interval development of perihilar haziness and slight
     prominence of the pulmonary vascularity, which may be due to reduced lung
     volumes or mild fluid overload.  Assessment of the lungs demonstrates
     increasing opacity in the left retrocardiac region.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     44-year-old man with hypertension urgency and acute mental status changes, now
     with continuous mental status changes despite improved blood pressure control.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted images were obtained throughout the
     brain.  MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) **] was also performed using 3D
     time-of-flight images, 3D reconstructions were subsequently performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  No previous examination available for comparison.
     
     Study is somewhat limited due to motion artifact.  White and [**Doctor Last Name **] matter
     differentiation is preserved.  No intracranial masses, no hemorrhages are
     seen.  Midline structures are normal in position.  Ventricles and subarachnoid
     spaces are within normal limits.  Few foci of increased T2 signal are seen
     throughout the periventricular white matter which may be related to vascular
     etiology such as hypertension or small chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
     Basal cisterns are patent.  Expected flow voids are visualized.
     
     Increased T2 signal intensity is seen within the mastoid air cells bilaterally
     consistent with fluid within the mastoid air cells.  Minimal mucosal
     thickening is seen involving the left sphenoid air cell.  Probable small fluid
     level is seen within the right sphenoid air cell.
     
     INTERPRETATION:  Limited examination due to motion artifact.  No intracranial
     masses visualized.  No acute stroke is seen.  Few foci of increased T2 signal
     in the periventricular white matter which may be related to chronic
     hypertension versus chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  Opacification of
     both mastoid air cells.
     
     MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 129**]:  Anterior and posterior circulations

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please evaluate interval change                                                 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
     
     INDICATION:  History of recent aspiration pneumonia now continued adventitial
     sounds.  Evaluate for interval change.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest obtained with patient in sitting upright
     position demonstrates the presence of a right-sided PICC line terminating
     overlying the SVC at the level 1 cm below the carina.  No evidence of
     pneumothorax or any other placement related complication.  The heart size is
     within normal limits without typical configurational abnormality.  Thoracic
     aorta unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The right-sided lateral
     pleural sinus is mildly blunted suggesting pleural scar formation with
     adhesion.  The left lateral pleural sinus is free.  No evidence of pleural
     fluid accumulation in the posterior pleural sinuses on either side, as seen on
     the lateral view.
     
     Comparison is made with a previous portable chest examination of [**3427-5-7**].  During the interval, patient has been extubated and an NG tube has been
     removed.  On previous examination, suspected retrocardiac parenchymal density
     has resolved and the findings are now normal.  Most likely the previous
     density consisted of a posterior segment atelectasis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Normalization of chest findings.  Good position of right-sided
     PICC line.

     44-year-old man with hypertension urgency and acute mental status changes, now
     with continuous mental status changes despite improved blood pressure control.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted images were obtained throughout the
     brain.  MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) **] was also performed using 3D
     time-of-flight images, 3D reconstructions were subsequently performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  No previous examination available for comparison.
     
     Study is somewhat limited due to motion artifact.  White and [**Doctor Last Name **] matter
     differentiation is preserved.  No intracranial masses, no hemorrhages are
     seen.  Midline structures are normal in position.  Ventricles and subarachnoid
     spaces are within normal limits.  Few foci of increased T2 signal are seen
     throughout the periventricular white matter which may be related to vascular
     etiology such as hypertension or small chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
     Basal cisterns are patent.  Expected flow voids are visualized.
     
     Increased T2 signal intensity is seen within the mastoid air cells bilaterally
     consistent with fluid within the mastoid air cells.  Minimal mucosal
     thickening is seen involving the left sphenoid air cell.  Probable small fluid
     level is seen within the right sphenoid air cell.
     
     INTERPRETATION:  Limited examination due to motion artifact.  No intracranial
     masses visualized.  No acute stroke is seen.  Few foci of increased T2 signal
     in the periventricular white matter which may be related to chronic
     hypertension versus chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  Opacification of
     both mastoid air cells.
     
     MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 129**]:  Anterior and posterior circulations
     are patent.  No aneurysms up to the level of resolution of this examination
     are identified.  No hemodynamically significant areas of stenosis are seen. 
     Distal vertebral arteries as well as basilar arteries are also normal in
     appearance.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Search for subclavian aneurysm in a 44-year-old man with
     gangrenous third and fourth right fingertips and concern for possible distal
     emboli.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the level of
     the subclavian arteries.
     
     The distal portion of the right intermediate artery could be visualized and
     its caliber was measured at 11.6 mm. The diameter of the right subclavian
     artery was measured at 10.8 mm proximally and 6.7 mm distally. By comparison,
     the diameter of the left subclavian artery was measured at 7.2 mm proximally
     and 6.3 mm distally. Thus, the caliber of the subclavian arteries is similar
     in their distal portion and slightly enlarged proximally on the right side as
     compared to the left. However, this fusiform enlargement corresponds to a
     ratio of 1.5 when comparing the proximal right subclavian artery to its left
     counterpart (10.8 / 7.2 = 1.5), which is at the borderline between a normal
     and an aneurysmal artery. On color Doppler imaging, flow is filling the entire
     lumen of this right subclavian artery, with no evidence of mural thrombus.
     
     Incidental note is made of a PICC line present in the right subclavian vein.  
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Mild fusiform enlargement of the proximal portion of the right subclavian
     artery, corresponding to a diameter of 150% as compared to the contralateral
     side. This corresponds to a borderline value for the definition of an
     aneurysm. No mural thrombus is seen.
     
     2. Incidental note of the presence of a PICC line in the right subclavian
     vein.

     TECHNIQUE:
     
     Attempted time resolved imaging was performed with the patient in both the
     prone position initially and then the supine abducted position.
     
     Examination was technically unsuccessful, due to the patient's movement and
     significant misregistration.
     
     No diagnostic quality images were obtained.  Given the patient's peripheral
     vascular access to the right side, hemodialysis fistula on the left side,
     limited foot axis and given the fact that high resolution imaging of the
     distal arteries as well as the remainder of the arterial supply to right hand
     is required, conventional arteriography is recommended.  Please note that over
     3 hours were spent in attempt to obtain a diagnostic quality MR angiogram, it
     was unlikely that further efforts with this modality will be successful.

     in the right groin and abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is minimal atelectasis at the right
     lung base.  The lung fields are otherwise clear.  The visualized heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  The non-contrast enhanced liver, gallbladder,
     pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Calcific densities are
     seen within the bilateral kidneys, which may represent vascular calcifications
     or small renal stones.  There is no evidence for hydronephrosis or
     hydroureter.  The stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel
     are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of bowel wall edema or bowel
     obstruction.  There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  Calcifications are seen within the abdominal
     aorta and its branches.  There is no free or focal fluid within the abdomen.
     There is no free air.  Anasarca is noted within the subcutaneous tissues.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Within the right groin, anterior to the
     femoral artery and vein, is a 4.4 x 4.5 cm low-density rounded lesion. As
     contrast was not administered, the enhancement pattern of this mass cannot be
     assessed on this examination.  The rectum, sigmoid colon, distal ureters, and
     bladder are unremarkable.  The seminal vesicles and prostate contain
     calcifications.  Several small scattered lymph nodes are seen within the
     inguinal regions bilaterally, however, these do not meet CT criteria for
     pathologic enlargement.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.  Please note
     there are bilateral calcifications present within the vas deferens.  There is
     no free or focal fluid within the pelvis.

     INDICATION:  44-year-old man with fever of unknown origin and rigors with mass
     in the right groin and abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is minimal atelectasis at the right
     lung base.  The lung fields are otherwise clear.  The visualized heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  The non-contrast enhanced liver, gallbladder,
     pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Calcific densities are
     seen within the bilateral kidneys, which may represent vascular calcifications
     or small renal stones.  There is no evidence for hydronephrosis or
     hydroureter.  The stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel
     are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of bowel wall edema or bowel
     obstruction.  There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  Calcifications are seen within the abdominal
     aorta and its branches.  There is no free or focal fluid within the abdomen.
     There is no free air.  Anasarca is noted within the subcutaneous tissues.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Within the right groin, anterior to the
     femoral artery and vein, is a 4.4 x 4.5 cm low-density rounded lesion. As
     contrast was not administered, the enhancement pattern of this mass cannot be
     assessed on this examination.  The rectum, sigmoid colon, distal ureters, and
     bladder are unremarkable.  The seminal vesicles and prostate contain
     calcifications.  Several small scattered lymph nodes are seen within the
