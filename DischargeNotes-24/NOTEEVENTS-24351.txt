                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     INDICATION:  Mental status changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the head were obtained from the occiput to the
     vertex without intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in
     the left thalamus.  This measures 5.2 x 3.8 cm in greatest dimension. There
     are surrounding low attenuation changes consisting of edema.  High attenuation
     material is seen within the ventricles consistent with intraventricular
     extension of hemorrhage.  The lateral ventricles are moderately dilated.
     Hemorrhage extends into the superior midbrain. There is mass effect with
     displacement of the third ventricle to the right by approximately 1 cm., and
     anterolateral displacement of the left caudate and putamen.  Periventricular
     white matter foci of low attenuation are present, likely consistent with
     chronic microvascular infarctions.
     
     The osseous structures, mastoid air cells, and visualized paranasal sinuses
     are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large left thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension
     and hydrocephalus.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old woman with a past medical history 
significant for hypertension who was found down in parking lot 
with altered mental status on the evening of admission. 
Apparently, she was on a trip to [**Location (un) 5219**] to visit her sister and 
flew back to the [**Location (un) 695**] area earlier in the evening. She 
apparently was driving home from the airport, but between the 
airport and home, stopped at her place of work (she is a Home 
Health Aide). She was then found there in the parking lot 
unresponsive by a bystander. EMS was called and she was brought 
to [**Hospital1 25**] ED. Time schedule as it is known: 8:20pm, arrived at 
[**Location (un) 1322**]. 9:52pm, Neurology was paged regarding her soon arrival. 
9:55pm, she arrived. On initial exam, she reportedly had right 
sided facial droop and right-sided weakness. She was noted to 
have unequal pupils, with left pupil 5mm and right 3mm but both 
reactive. While she being stabilized in the ED, she vomited, had 
urinary incontinence and was intubated for airway protection. By 
10:10pm her pupils were both dilated and fixed.

 
Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Amputation of left toes
 
Social History:
Divorced. Worked as a home health aide. Has one child, [**Doctor First Name 516**], in 
the area.

General Appearance-Intubated.
HEENT: Mucosa moist. Oropharynx clear. No scleral icterus or 
injection.
Neck: Supple.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal s1/s2 heart sounds. 
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended.
Extremities: Warm. No edema.

-----
CT head without contrast [**2938-10-19**]: There is a large area of 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left thalamus. This 
measures 5.2 x 3.8 cm in greatest dimension. There are 
surrounding low attenuation changes consisting of edema. High 
attenuation material is seen within the ventricles consistent 
with intraventricular extension of hemorrhage. The lateral 
ventricles are moderately dilated. Hemorrhage extends into the 
superior midbrain. There is mass effect with displacement of the 
third ventricle to the right by approximately 1 cm., and 
anterolateral displacement of the left caudate and putamen. 
Periventricular white matter foci of low attenuation are 
present, likely consistent with chronic microvascular 
infarctions. The osseous structures, mastoid air cells, and 
visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Large 
left thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and 
hydrocephalus.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 70 year old  woman with known history of hypertension 
who presented with elevated blood pressure right-sided weakness 
and vomiting. Her status rapidly deteriorated in the ED, 
requiring emergent intubation for airway protection. On later 
exam, she had fixed and dilated pupils, absence of oculocephalic 
and gag reflexes and bilateral decerebrate posturing, all 
consistent with brainstem compression. Head CT revealed a large 
left basal ganglia bleed with right-sided shift, 
intraventricular hemorrhage with blood in fourth ventricle and 
obstructive hydrocephalus. Neurosurgery was contacted regarding 
role of ventriculostomy; given the patient's grave prognosis, 
they did not feel a drain was warranted.

The severity of the patient's condition was discussed with her 
daughter. Patient remained full code overnight from [**Date range (1) 5220**] 
per her daughter's wishes. She was transported to the intensive 
care unit where she received maximal medical management with 
blood pressure control, mannitol, and dilantin therapies. 

The following morning, the patient's exam was remarkable for 
continued brainstem compression. By noon on [**2938-10-20**], she had 
absence of brainstem function and she was no longer 
overbreathing her ventilator. A meeting was held between the 
neurology team, ICU team, nursing staff, and patient's daugther 
and sister. The gravity of the patient's condition was outlined 
for her family. Later that evening, the patient's daughter opted 
to withdraw care and focus on comfort measures only. The patient 
was extubated and expired shortly thereafter.

Pt's daughter in and out all afternoon accompanied by many friends for support. At 7PM daughter asked to speak to the doctors about taking the breathing tube out and making her mother comfort measures only. After speaking to neuro med and TSICU team the decision was made to stop life support, start morphine drip and stop all meds. This was done, pt extubated at 8:10PM after initiating morphine drip. Family is at her side. Pt did not have any resp effort post extubation. BP/HR slowed and pt's heart stopped. Pt pronounced by team and will be transported to the morgue.
