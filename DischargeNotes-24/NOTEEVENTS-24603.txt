History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with a PMH of ESRD secondary 
to DM, on HD who was in her usual state of health until she 
presented at HD with altered mental status and hypotension. She 
initiated HD about 2 weeks ago, dialyzing M,W,F. She was then 
sent to the OSH ED for evaulation of her hypotension. At the 
[**Hospital6 4334**] she was found to have a WBC of 41.7 
with 94 segmented neutrophils. Her labs were also notable for a 
HCT of 29.4. Also of note, she had an alk phos of 1023. At the 
OSH ED, she received 2 L NS, 3.375 mg zosyn, and 1 gm vancomycin 
after blood and urine cultures were sent. She was started on 
dopamine for a blood pressure of 53/45. Arrangements were made 
for transfer to our ED.  
The patient notes that she has not taken her medications for two 
days because she ran out of some of them. She also states that 
she is in chronic stable back and abdominal pain. The pain 
starts in the right flank and radiates to the right UQ and 
axilla. MRCP done to evaluate this was negative for stones but a 
biopsy of the liver showed mucinous adenocarcinoma on [**2842-9-4**].  
.  
ROS: + night sweats, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, emesis x 1. 
denies CP, hematemesis or hematochezia  

 
Past Medical History:

Conclusions:  
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.  
2. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The 
left  
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular 
wall motion is  
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic 
(EF>75%). There is  
a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

1. Large, diffuse infiltrating mass within the right lobe of the 
liver with possible peritoneal carcinomatosis. Enlarged 
retroperitoneal lymph[**MD Number 298**], left adrenal mass and multiple lung 
nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
2. Small, bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation, likely from the obstructing 
tumor.
............
[**2842-10-3**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Right axis deviation. There is a late 
transition with 
anterior and anterolateral and lateral ST-T wave changes 
consistent with 
possible right ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia. Compared to 
the previous 
tracing of [**2842-10-1**] right axis deviation is new and the ST-T wave 
changes are 
more prominent.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
1. Large, diffuse infiltrating mass within the right lobe of the 
liver with 
possible peritoneal carcinomatosis. Enlarged retroperitoneal 
lymph[**MD Number 298**], 
left adrenal mass and multiple lung nodules consistent with 
metastatic 
disease. A contrast-enhanced study is recommended. If renal 
function 
precludes this, consider MRI. 
2. Small, bilateral pleural effusions. 
3. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation, likely from the obstructing 
tumor. 
 

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 66 y.o. with ESRD on HD with markedly elevated WBC and 
hypotension of unclear etiology.  
.
# hypotension: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] presented with persistent hypotension 
of unclear source. She was not previuosly dialyzed.  Sepsis was 
considered from HD line or intraabdominal process. Pancytopenia 
in presence of leukocytosis concerning for hematologic 
malignancy. She had daily blood cultures, none of which grew 
anything by the time of this summary. Cultures from the OSH did 
not grow anything. Her diltiazem was held. She required 2 
pressors, and was still somewhat hypotensive. She was treated 
with vanco, levo, flagyl for a possible line infection. Renal 
was consulted and it was decided not to pull her HD line in case 
she needed dialysis. CT of the abdomen showed a large mass in 
the right lobe of her liver, with possible peritoneal and lymph 
node involvement. Over the course of her short stay her blood 
pressure remained low. He son [**Name (NI) **] was consulted and she was 
made DNR/DNI. He flew up from [**State **] to see her and to talk 
with his family about CMO. Shortly after his arrival Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] 
died of cardiac arrest.
.  
# leukocytosis: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] had an elevated WBC count of unclear 
source. As discussed above all cultures were negative, and she 
received empiric antibiotic treatment with vanc, levo, flagyl. A 
TTE evaluation for vegetations (she had a murmur) was negative. 
Hematology/oncology was consulted, and felt that she had 
incurable disease with a grim prognosis. In her condition on 
admission there was no possible treatment option. This was 
discussed with her son [**Name (NI) **], and contributed to his decision to 
make her DNR/DNI.
.  
# ESRD: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] had been on HD for the last 2 weeks prior to 
admission. There was no indication for acute HD although she 
missed a few dialysis appointments. However, her HD line was 
left in place in case she did need HD during her stay. Given her 
clinical deterioration though, she was not dialysed.  
.  
#Coagulopathy - Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] had an elevated PTT and PT which was 
thought to possible be due to liver disease, or her large tumor 
burden. DIC panel was negative.
.
# DM: Mrs.[**Known patient lastname 5698**] sugars were controlled with a RISS.  
.  
# hepatic mucinous adenocarcinoma: Hematology/oncology was 
consulted, and felt that she had incurable disease with a grim 
prognosis. In her condition on admission there was no possible 
treatment option. LFTs were followed and were elevated 
throughout, particularly AST and Alk Phos. Her pain was 
controlled on her home regimen of oxycodone.
.  
# prophylaxis: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was on a PPI, SQ heparin, and a bowel 
regimen  
.  
# full code on admission, then DNR/DNI, then expired before 
family decided on CMO. 
.  
# access: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] had a LIJ, L A-line  
.  
# Dispo: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] died Monday [**10-6**] at 9PM of cardiac 
arrest, thought to be secondary to her malignancy. An autopsy 
was declined by her family.

MICU A Nursing Progress Note (2300-0700)

Please see carevue for all objective data and FHPA for nursing admission information. Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with ESRD on HD who was noted to have MS changes and hypotension with dialysis treatment [**10-1**]. Sent to NWH, WBC of 41, elevated alk phos. Treated with IVF and antibiotics and dopamine.

History includes DM, CHF, pneumonia and liver CA.

CNS: Initially alert and oriented x 3. Somewhat agitated, asking for ""help"", wanting to sit at the edge of the bed. She does complain of diffuse abdominal pain which radiates around to her back (baseline). Pt. takes oxycontin and prn oxycodone at home. Vicodin ordered initially and given..subsequently changed to oxycodone for pain control. Pt. received 1mg dilaudid and .5mg ativan during line placements with good effect. She is now quite lethargic, yet does awaken to verbal stimuli. Confused as to place and time however post sedation. Prior to sedation, pt. stated she wished to be a full code.

SOCIAL: Son,[**Doctor Last Name 465**], and his girlfriend accompanied pt. to the unit. When in to visit...he was very diaphoretic and agitated, tearful. Suggestion was made that he go to EW to be seen re:distress at mother's condition. He then became angry and defensive, stating he did ""not need any help"". Attempt made to update him on his mother's condition and he again became angry, stating ""[**Doctor First Name **] don't know what [**Doctor First Name **] are doing...I'm taking her out of here"". He eventually calmed down and left for remainder of the night. He was given the telephone# and strict visiting guidelines were stressed (12 to 8pm, 10min every hour). Low threshold for calling security when son visits. Some question as to protective services involvement with this family in the past. Of note, pt's mother is at the home also, apparently quite ill.

SEPSIS: T max of 100, WBC up to 60. Pt. received one dose of vanc at NWH and has been started on flagyl and levo. Pt. received peripheral dopamine for prolonged period of time prior to central line being placed. (IV in left AC functioning without problem, no signs of infiltration). B/P readings also somewhat variable per NBP until arterial line was placed. Unable to wean dopa down past 10mcg/kg/min as SBP drops to the 70's. CVP found to be [**2-14**] despite additional liter of NS in MICU. Currently receiving another 500cc with B/P 120/syst on 11mcg/kg/min of dopa. CVP now up to 6. Pt received [**Last Name (un) 414**] stim test, yet 60min level will be inaccurate due to lack of access at the time. 

RESP: Lungs with diminished breath sounds throughout. Unable to obtain accurate sats. ABG acceptable at 7.34 43 113 24 2. No cough or sputum.

GI: Abdomen soft and distended with active bowel sounds throughout. Pt. able to take sips of water without difficulty. No stool overnight.

RENAL: No urine output, foley in place.

SKIN: Intact

HEME: Coagulopathic with INR of 1.7, PTT of 90 and PT of 15. Hct 34.

ENDO: Fingersicks q6hr, no sliding scale coverage required as of yet. Blood sugars have been <150

Events: Bedside echo done awaiting results in ccc. 

Neuro: Initially pt A+Ox2 and quite lethargic but briefly arousable. Currently pt A+Ox3 and able to interact appropriately and make needs known. Pt remains sleepy however. MAE, following commands. C/O general discomfort. Repositioned often. Given 5mg Oxycodone x1. 

Resp: Lung sounds clear in apices and very diminished in bases. O2 sat difficult to get clear tracing but is in mid to high 90's. Afternoon ABG 7.31/39/131/21. O2 weaned to 3L via n/c from 4. Pt preferrs sitting up straight to laying back to ease breathing. 

Cardiac: ST with no ectopy on monitor. HR 100-120. Initially on 11mcg/kg/min Dopamine. Changed to levophed this am current rate 0.05mcg/kg/min. . Bolused x3 for a total of 2L NS with good effect but still unable to wean off levophed. Last CVP 9. 

GI: Abd soft and nontender. hypoactive bowel sounds. No BM this shift. Appetite poor much of day. Currently eating dinner. Blood sugars 130-150's. covered with ss insulin as needed. 

GU: Pt anuric throughout shift. approx 10cc out for entire shift. MD aware. Unclear wether or not she makes much urine at baseline. Had HD yesterday at osh. Unsure when next HD treatment will be. 

Derm Grossly intact. L IJ tlc site wnl, aline site benign,. 

Social: Social work consulting. Son called x3 but has not visited. 

Plan: Wean pressors as tolerated, bolus as needed. follow culture data, IV abx as ordered. monitor hemodynamic status and mental status, Socaial work following.

     with metastatic disease.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a large, infiltrating tumor
     involving most of the right lobe of the liver.  There is intrahepatic biliary
     dilatation within the liver as seen on the previous ultrasound.  Tumor appears
     to be extending outside of the liver and in close proximity to the IVC.  A
     second lesion is seen anteriorly in the liver between segments 2 and 4.  There
     are enlarged aortocaval, retrocrural and retroperitoneal nodes.  There are
     gallstones.  There is ascites.  There are areas of nodularity and stranding
     within the peritoneum, which suggest peritoneal carcinomatosis. There is a
     mass within the left adrenal gland.  The pancreas is atrophic but a definite
     pancreatic mass is not identified without IV contrast.  The spleen and kidneys
     are unremarkable allowing for the lack of IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is diffuse stranding within the
     subcutaneous tissues consistent with anasarca.  There is a small amount of
     free fluid within the pelvis.  A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     There are old left-sided rib fractures.

ROS: 
NEURO/COMFORT: Pt c/o general discomfort when lying in bed; [**Known patient lastname **] relief w/oxycodone. Very restless, picking at lines, tossing and turning. Ultimately OOB to chair at 0100 with improvement. She has remained restless but at least has been dozing at times. Benadryl was given at MN with [**Known patient lastname **] effect. Pt is oriented to self, hospital, month and year (not date). When in bed she repeatedly called out for help, but was unable to state what she needed/wanted. Since she's been in the chair she's been much more content. 
RESP: Remains on 3l NC with acceptable sats when we are able to get them. RR teens, labored with acctivity. Pt states breathing is better. LS CTA upper, very diminished lower, especially on the right.
C-V: HR low 100's, ST, no VEA. BP somewhat labile. Initially able to wean Levo slowly to .052 mcg/kg/min, but soon had to increase again. Currently at .084 mcg/kg/min. CVP 6-7. Lytes WNL. Pt has had cool extremites all shift, though pulses are weakly palpable; skin noted to be cool and clammy since ~2300 (HO aware). 
ID: Afebrile, WBC down to 53.9 (60.2). BC X 1 sent w/AM labs. Cont's on abx. 
GU: Pt anuric; ? what her baseline is. She has repeatedly asked to have foley removed, but team prefers to keep it in. BUN/creat stable at 55/5.6.
GI: Belly obese, soft, active BS; no stool. 
ENDO: FSBS WNL; no insulin needed. 
HEME: Hct stable at 32.3 (34.4); plt's down to 145 (179). No evidence of bleeding. 
SOCIAL: Pt's son called her several times during the evening; his voice was audible and he seemed to be upset. However, pt did not appear upset by his calls, and wanted to continue to talk to him, referring to him as her ""big baby boy"". 

A: unable to wean levo significantly

P: continue attempts to wean levo; check w/team regarding fluids; keep pt up in chair as much as possible; minimize tubes/lines to decrease restlessness; per renal pt to be dialyzed today; will need vanco dose post-HD; continue supportive care.

Events: Upsetting day for Ms [**Known patient lastname **]. Son  has been admitted to CCU with chest pain at hosp in [**Location (un) 734**]. 

Social: Pt's son was admitted to CCU in [**Location (un) **] with chest pain last noc. Received call from son's friend telling me that he's in the hosp, is withdrawing from heroin, and has pulled out all access/wires and was leaving ama to come here to see mother. I spoke with son over phone and convinced him that his mother was [**Name2 (NI) **] and that he should stay in hosp for care. Son is currently still in hosp in [**Location (un) 734**]. Also, pt's mother is [**Name2 (NI) **], demented and lives at home with her and son. Social Services is following and had pt's mother admitted to [**Hospital1 3**] as social admit as she is dependent for care. Pt is very upset at current circumstances and is completely overwhelmed at day's events. Security is aware. 

Neuro: Pt is a+ox2, cannot remember date. [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 26**], 2 assist to transfer to chair, C/O discomfort and generalized pain (back/head)Tx with oxycodone and sitting in chair with some relief. Pt is most comfortable sitting up in chair. She squirms and is very restless when in bed. Pt is VERY needy and dramatic. Numerous vague complaints.  Pulls at lines/equipment constantly and has a hard time sitting still at all. Pt did not [**Doctor Last Name **] much last noc and is quite exhausted.

Cardiac: Remains dependent on levophed for b/p. Current dose is 1.5mcg/kg/min . There is a large difference (20pts) between nbp readings R>L.  R sided nbp correlates with abp better. Pt waves arm around and plays with aline alot making it difficult to obtain accurate readings. She does however have rapid drops in b/p at times. CVP has been [**3-15**] this shift. No fluid boluses given. 

Resp: Currently on 5L O2 via n/c with O2 sats in upper 90's. ABG this am showing Pao2 of 62 while on 3L. Repeat on 5L was 100. Lung sounds clear in apices and very diminished at bases. 

GI: Abd soft/nontender, no bm this shift, appetite poor, taking in fluids and drinks nepro shakes. Blood sugars unremarkable. 

Gu: Urine output anuric. Approx 8cc's this shift. HD done at bedside this shift. 

Derm: Grossly intact with 2+ edema in legs. LIJ site intact, aline site intact. diaphoretic at times. 

ID: HD line bld cx drawn, continues on vancomycin, flagyl, and levo. Order to cx urine when she makes enough. Currently afebrile. Renal service believes she is not septic but her grossly elevated 52 wbc count is due to a hematologic process related to liver. 

Plan: Chest/Abd CT tonight, needs to drink contrast, continue to monitor hemodynamic status, coping support, follow cultures, Full Code

CVP to left jugular ranging [**3-17**].  renal doesn't want to give fluids. lower extremities grossly edenamous with difficulty with papable pedal pules. all  extremites cool to touch due to levophed

GI/ENDO:  Abd softly distended.  hypoactive bowel sounds, last BM was on tuesday.  on bowel regimen.  poor appetite, but apparently drinks the boost shakes.  had ctscan of abd last night.  results???  Recent Dx of liver CA ([**2842-9-4**]).  fingersticks with sliding scale.  last night 170.  

GU:  on hemodialysis, MWF.  was scheduled to get HD on saturday due to anticipation of getting ctscan IV constrast dye.  did not receive due to pt sts had past allergic reaction to it.  so, HD not really indicated for today.  right SC vascath (bc drawn yesterday from that line)  has foley with scant amount of urine.  need a urine sample.  currently clamped.  

ID: WBC today 60. treating pt as septic but renal feels level is high due to hepatic dysfunction associated with liver CA.  afebrile.  

Skin:  ashy/ renal [**Last Name (un) **].  psoriasis to right buttocks.  

IV:  KVO to left jugluar TLC.  Aline to right radial.

Social:  pt lives with her mother and son.  currently mother was admitted last night to Risemen 11 as a social admission due to the fact that she is legally blind and has dementia.  Son is currently hospitalized as different hospital for Chest pain/ herorin withdrawal.  Social services are on the case and will follow up with evaluating safety of home.  

Plan:  titrate levophed down/off. consider d/c aline due to inconsistance of readings and unable to accurately tirtate levo down.

Increasingly hypotensive w/ Levophed at max dose of 0.4mcg/kg/min. increasing HR, now 130. Aline infiltrated, tenous fluid volume status. awaiting oncology's reccomendations re: prognosis and appropriateness of further aggressive care. 

ROS-

CV- NSR, HR 110-130's, increasing throughout the day. no ectopy. NIBP 80-100 on 0.4 mcg/kg/min levophed. will start vasopressing as next pressor. extremities very cool, cyanotic. poor peripheral pulses. hematoma to R arm from ALine infiltration. 

RESP- has been intermittently on 3-4L NC w/ SPO2 >90%. but pt pulls off O@ and O2 sat frequently. LS diminished, uppers clear. no cough. + dyspnea on exertion. 

NEURO- very somnolent. c/o almost constant pain in her back, abd and legs, ?from Ca. started on fentanyl patch today. changed to MS contin and prn IV morphine today. pt doses off frequently, repeatedly mumbling ""just wait a minute"". weakly MAE, needs alot of encouragement to participate in ADL's.

     HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease.  CHF, hypotension, and leukocytosis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-2**] and 24:
     
     Moderate-sized right pleural effusion is increasing.  There is either a new
     region of consolidation in the right upper lobe sitting on the minor fissure
     or simulation of a lung abnormality by fissural pleural fluid.  Right heart
     border is obscured by pleural effusion but there does not appear to be
     appreciable cardiomegaly.  Mediastinum is midline and normal caliber.  Mild
     atelectasis is present at the base of the left lung which is otherwise clear. 
     The longer line of a dual channel right supraclavicular central venous
     catheter ends in the right atrium while the shorter catheter tip projects over
     the SVC alongside a left internal jugular line.  No pneumothorax.
