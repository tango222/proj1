CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2795-4-7**] 
PORTABLY AP CHEST X-RAY: Interval placement of a tracheostomy 
tube. There has been interval removal of an NG tube. No 
pneumothorax is identified. No definite subcutaneous air is 
seen. Mediastinal contour and cardiac contours are unchanged. 
Again seen are alveolar opacities bilaterally, but much more 
prominent on the left. This is not significantly changed from 
prior exam.

IMPRESSION:

Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube and removal of an ET 
tube and NG tube. No definite pneumothorax or subcutaneous air 
identified. The exam is not significantly changed.

EKG Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact. Compared to the 
previous tracing 
of [**2795-3-29**] the rate has increased. No evidence of acute or old 
ischemia

1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal 
technical  
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Overall  
left ventricular systolic function is very difficult to assess 
but is probably  
normal.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course outlined by problem below:

# Respiratory failure- multifactorial. Has restrictive 
(charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-tooth, left hemidiaphragmatic weakness s/p 
plication, right upper lobectomy, on CPAP at home at night) and 
obstructive (COPD) components. Also has had two recent 
consecutive aspiration pneumonias. Sputum w/ acinobacter at osh, 
now w/oroflora. At [**Hospital1 25**], sputums only grew out oropharyngeal 
flora.  He was continued on levo, and vancoand showed 
imporovement in respiratory status.  He was extubated on  [**4-2**] 
however he showed progressive resp distress over the next 2 days 
requiring reintubation.  CXR showed worsening left sided 
pneumonia and he had a leukocytosis.  REmained afebrile.  Flagyl 
was added and he responded well with decreasing WBC and 
decreased respiratory distress.  He underwent tracheostomy and 
was able to tolerate minimal pressure support by the time of 
discharge on PSV 5/5 for period of time and allowed to rest on 
higher pressure support.  He received steroids for his COPD and 
which has now been tapered off.  His vanc, levo, flagyl will be 
continued unitl  [**2795-4-16**].  Given his reestrictive disease 
(charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-tooth, left hemidiaphragm disease, and new right 
lobectomy) he will liklely need longterm support with 
ventilation.

## sedation - did well with haldol standing order.  This may be 
stopped if he tolerates his trach without aggitation.  He 
sundowns so may require it at night.

# Hypotension - he was received on pressors, but these were 
rapidly titrated off and he maintained good blood pressures.  He 
was given a short course of stress dose steroids (hydrocort 50mg 
qid both for his hypotension at the OSH and his COPD 
exacerbation).
  
# NSTEMI- asa, bb. s/p cards consult, r-sided ekg nl. Liekly was 
demand ischemiea in the setting of his hypotension.  His echo, 
albeit of poor quality shows a normal EF and no WMA.  He was 
started on a beta blocker, aggressive statin, ASA.  He will need 
an ACEI for long term benefit of his CAD.  He was diuresed until 
euvolemic which imporved his hypoxia.  Would continue to diurese 
until patient BUN/Cre bump. 

# Lung cancer-Stage 2-poor prognosis with 20-30% chance for cure 
with surgery alone. Adjuvent chemo would only add an additional 
5% chance for cure. Heme-onc consult discussed prognosis with 
family and as of discharge the pt not aware of the final path 
results yet. He can follow up with the [**Hospital 2067**] [**Hospital 5288**] clinic for 
further follow up.

Plan: Will continue to feed pt through NGT for now as it was thought to be too risky to place the GT as pt's anatomy would not allow safe placement. If this becomes the only option there is a not in the chart stating it would have to be place by open incision.  Plan is for pt to go to rehab, possibly next week.

     INDICATION:  61-year-old man with lung cancer, restaging.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images pre- and post-gadolinium.
     
     FINDINGS:  No priors for comparison.
     
     T2 and FLAIR hyperintense lesions in both corona radiata indicate chronic
     microvascular infarction.  No hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
     structures, major vascular territorial or intracranial mass lesions are
     identified.  There is motion degrading some of the post-contrast images;
     however, no areas of enhancement are identified.  Within the limits of this
     examination, surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
