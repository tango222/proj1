Admission Date:  [**3284-6-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**3284-6-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**3206-8-26**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital 4510**] MEDICAL SERVICE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old lady, with
a history of Crohn's disease, transferred from an outside
hospital for work-up and treatment of severe GI bleed
following colonoscopy.  The patient was admitted on
[**3284-6-6**] to outside hospital for profuse diarrhea after
starting Creon two weeks prior.  Hematocrit on admission was
34.

The patient was treated with IV steroids, pancrease and
cholestyramine for pancreatic insufficiency and bile stone
malabsorption.  On [**6-13**], she underwent colonoscopy to the
neoterminal ileum notable for anastomotic opening slightly
tight and friable lesions which were biopsied.  Biopsy of
other random sites was also taken, as well as a less than 1
cm polyp which was also removed.  Following the procedure,
the patient developed hypotension, decreased hematocrit, and
an increased INR.  The patient was then transferred to the
outside hospital's ICU.

Emergent colonoscopy showed old blood, but no active
hemorrhage.  This study did not reveal a source of bleeding.
An EGD was performed which was also negative.  The patient
was then transferred to [**Hospital6 84**]
for further evaluation.  At the outside hospital en route to
[**Hospital1 **], the patient received a total of 2
liters of normal saline, 6 units of FFP, and 6 units of
packed red blood cells.

The patient experienced respiratory distress while in the
ambulance and was intubated and given 80 mg lasix.  Upon
arrival, she was emergently taken to the Angio Suite where
she underwent embolization of the third branch of the
superior mesenteric artery.  This resulted in near-cessation
of bleeding.  The patient was admitted to the Medical ICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Crohn's disease:  Last colonoscopy
in [**7-/3281**] showed no active disease.  Her last admission to
the hospital for Crohn's was in [**3284-2-22**] for a Crohn's
flare for which she was treated with steroids;  2) Status
post right hemicolectomy;  3) Status post anteriorly.
Cardiac exam revealed LOA. 4) Status post small bowel
resection.  5) Hypertension.  6) Coronary artery disease.  7)
Left superficial femoral vein DVT.  8) Hyperlipidemia.  9)
History of lower GI bleeding.  10) Status post appendectomy.
11) History of congestive heart failure.  Echo prior to
current admission was within normal limits.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:  1) Creon 10 mg 3 tablets tid, 2) gemfibrozil
600 mg bid, 3) atenolol 25 mg qd, 4) Aciphex 20 mg qd, 5)
Effexor 35 mg qd for 7 days, then increase to 75 mg qd, 6)
cholestyramine 1 package tid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone with a pet cat.  Her
daughter lives in [**State 427**] and has been involved with
her care.  She denies any tobacco or alcohol use.  Her
husband lives in a nursing home in [**Location (un) 954**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ARRIVAL TO MICU:  Revealed a
temperature of 97.3, pulse 124, blood pressure 143/75, 98% O2
saturation.  Generally, she was pale, visibly intubated, and
sedated.  Her pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation
bilaterally anteriorly.  Her cardiac examination revealed
tachycardia without any murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdominal
exam was notable for multiple abdominal scars.  Her extremity
exam revealed no edema.

LABORATORY:  Laboratory values were notable for a hematocrit
of 26.6 which was down from 37.2 the day prior to arrival
here at [**Hospital1 25**].  The remainder of her serum electrolytes were
within normal limits except for a calcium of 7.1.  Arterial
blood gases revealed a pH of 7.1, PCO2 56, PO2 112.  Blood
coagulation studies were notable for a PT of 13, INR 1.4, PTT
30.  EKG dated [**6-6**] from the outside hospital was notable
for T wave inversions in leads III and AVF.  Chest x-ray was
notable for left lower collapse and consolidation and small
bilateral pleural effusions.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 874**] hospital course
will be described by problem.  In summary, this is a
77-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, status
post right hemicolectomy, status post coil embolization for
massive lower GI bleed, who is now transferred to the [**Hospital1 25**]
for management of lower GI bleed.  The patient was admitted
to the MICU following the embolization procedure on
[**3284-6-14**].  The patient was then transferred to the floor on
[**3284-6-19**] for continued medical care.

1) LOWER GI BLEED:  The patient had a massive lower GI bleed
following colonoscopy and biopsy of various lesions within
her colon.  This bleeding was stopped primarily via
embolization of the third branch of the SMA.  In the Medical
ICU, she was volume resuscitated with several units of packed
red blood cells and IV fluids.

Over the course of her MICU stay, her GI bleeding slowly
waned over the period of several days.  Her hematocrit
stabilized to the lower 30s upon transferring to the medical
floor.  Her bowel movements at that point were no longer
grossly bloody.  For the duration of her stay on the medicine
service, she did not experience any bright red blood per
rectum, and her bowel movements were heme negative.  There
was no evidence of occult bleeding by checking daily
hematocrits which remained stable until her discharge.

2) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  During the course of her stay
in the Medical ICU, she was vigorously resuscitated with
fluids and blood, and subsequently was found to be in florid
CHF.  A repeat echocardiogram was performed which revealed an
ejection fraction of 25%.  This was different from her
previous echocardiogram prior to her admission which was
within normal limits.  The thought was that the patient had
suffered an ischemic event to her heart leading to decreased
systolic function.

Over the course of her ICU stay, she developed chest x-ray
findings consistent with heart failure, as well as clinical
exam findings which included elevated jugular venous
pressure, lower extremity edema, and bilateral dullness to
percussion at the lung bases.  When the patient was finally
extubated prior to leaving the ICU, she began to autodiurese
at least 1.5-2 liters per day.

After arriving to the floor, we continued to treat her with
carvedilol and captopril which was later changed to
lisinopril.  She was also monitored for fluid loss by daily
weights and daily in's and out's.  For the duration of her
stay in the hospital, she did not require any pharmacologic
agents for diuresis.  Furthermore, as each day passed, her
clinical exam findings improved.

3) PNEUMONIA:  In the ICU, she was found to have sputum
positive for Klebsiella.  There was also a suspicious
retrocardiac opacity on chest x-ray.  She was started on
Levofloxacin and Zosyn initially until culture results
revealed pansensitive Klebsiella in the sputum, at which
point Zosyn was discontinued.  Levofloxacin was continued.

4) VOCAL CORD PARALYSIS/ASPIRATION:  Following extubation in
the Medical ICU, she was found to be unable to speak.  A
bedside swallowing study revealed aspiration of thin and
nectar-like liquids.  ENT consultation revealed right vocal
cord paresis with unclear etiology.

A head and neck CT was performed to rule out any stroke or
mass compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  These exams
were negative.  In the meantime, an NG tube was left in
place.  The patient was made NPO.  Aspiration precautions
were taken, and she was continued on her Protonix prophylaxis
40 mg po bid.

A few days after her transfer to the floor from the ICU, the
patient underwent a video swallowing study which revealed,
again, aspiration of thin liquids and nectar-like fluids.
The patient also aspirated solids.  Of note, she was found
not able to cough reflexively to aspiration, and when cued to
cough, she was unable to clear any aspirated content for any
of the liquid.

The decision was then made to establish a semipermanent
feeding tube placement to obviate the need for an NG tube.
The patient was taken to Interventional Radiology where she
underwent placement of a gastrojejunostomy tube.

Following the procedure, there was a small amount of bright
blood refluxing from the nasogastric tube which cleared
several hours later.  This was felt to be likely due to a
small amount of postprocedural gastric bleeding.  The GJ tube
was found to be in good working order, and she was restarted
on her tube feeds via her new GJ tube.  The NG tube was then
discontinued.

5) CROHN'S DISEASE:  The patient has a longstanding history
of Crohn's disease and is status post right hemicolectomy and
small bowel resection.  She currently has stable disease now
on a regimen of prednisone.  During her course here, she has
not undergone any obvious manifestations of any ongoing
Crohn's flare.  The gastroenterology service was consulted
throughout her stay.

6) HYPERNATREMIA:  This was thought to be due to a decreased
amount of total body free water.  During her course in the
ICU, as well as on the floor, she was given free water
boluses.  During her course on the floor, her sodium came
back down to within normal limits.

7) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  During her stay in the Medical ICU,
her creatinine was found to be elevated over the first two
days in the ICU with a peak at 1.4.  This was thought to be
due to prerenal causes.  With fluid resuscitation, her
creatinine came back down to within normal limits.

8) MCA ANEURYSM:  When the patient had undergone a head CT
for evaluation of her vocal cord paresis, an MCA aneurysm was
incidentally found.  The patient underwent angiogram to
better image the lesion which was followed by a CT angiogram.
This was determined not to be an urgent issue by the
neurointerventional radiologists.  The patient will undergo
follow-up therapy per neurointerventional radiology.

9) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient has apparently
experienced an ischemic event to her heart.  While in the
Medical ICU, laboratory tests revealed an elevation of her
troponin levels to a maximum of 0.44, evidenced when she
arrived to the floor she was given a Persantine MIBI test to
evaluate for any ischemic myocardium.  This test revealed:
1) Moderate partially reversible defects of the distal
anterior apex and inferolateral walls of the heart; 2) Mild
transient ischemic dilatation; 3) Hypokinesis of the apex and
septum with global EF calculated to be 49%.  It was
determined that the likely cause of her congestive heart
failure was secondary to an ischemic insult to her heart.

10) VACCINATIONS:  The patient received pneumovax x 1.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1) Gastrointestinal bleeding.
2) Congestive heart failure.
3) Pneumonia.
4) Coronary artery disease.
5) Paretic right vocal cord.
6) Middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
7) Crohn's disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1) prednisone 35 mg po qd
2) Levofloxacin 500 mg po q 24 h until [**3284-6-28**]
3) lisinopril 5 mg po qd--hold for systolic blood pressure of
less than 95
4) carvedilol 6.25 mg po twice a day
5) Creon 10, 2 capsules po four times a day
6) pantoprazole 40 mg po q 12 h
7) cholestyramine 4 gm po twice a day
8) venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg po qd

     polypectomy, with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 602**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1197**],
     with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1197**] present and supervising.  The patient was brought to the
     Angiography Suite and placed supine on the table.  The left groin was prepped
     and draped in the usual steile fashion.  The left femoral artery was palpated.
     5 cc of 1% Lidocaine was injected into the subcutaneous tissues of the left
     groin. The left common femoral artery was entered with a 19-gauge single-wall
     needle.
      A .035 [**Last Name (un) 108**] wire was advanced into the aorta.  The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French sheath.  An Omniflush 4 French catheter was advanced over the
     wire and placed with the tip at the T11 level.  An arteriogram was performed
     at this level.  There was noted to be a widely patent superior mesenteric
     artery but no inferior mesenteric artery was identified.  The catheter was
     repositioned with the tip at the L2 level, and another arteriogram was
     performed.  The catheter was then exchanged for a 5 French Cobra catheter.
     Selective cannulation was made in the SMA.  Another arteriogram was performed
     and revealed extravasation of contrast in a distal branch of the SMA at the
     region of the ileum.  The Cobra catheter was exchanged for a Fast Tracker
     catheter. This catheter was passed into the SMA down to the level of the
     mesenteric border of the loop of bowel at the site of contrast extravasation.
     Embolization was then performed with placement of three 1-cm length Torpedoes.
     This was followed by three 1 cm x 3 mm coils. After the deployment of these
     coils, a selective arteriogram was performed, which revealed no contrast
     extravasation.
      The Tracker catheter was then removed.  The sheath was removed, and
     hemostasis was achieved with 20 minutes of direct compression.
                                                                 (Over)

     repositioned with the tip at the L2 level, and another arteriogram was
     performed.  The catheter was then exchanged for a 5 French Cobra catheter.
     Selective cannulation was made in the SMA.  Another arteriogram was performed
     and revealed extravasation of contrast in a distal branch of the SMA at the
     region of the ileum.  The Cobra catheter was exchanged for a Fast Tracker
     catheter. This catheter was passed into the SMA down to the level of the
     mesenteric border of the loop of bowel at the site of contrast extravasation.
     Embolization was then performed with placement of three 1-cm length Torpedoes.
     This was followed by three 1 cm x 3 mm coils. After the deployment of these
     coils, a selective arteriogram was performed, which revealed no contrast
     extravasation.
      The Tracker catheter was then removed.  The sheath was removed, and
     hemostasis was achieved with 20 minutes of direct compression.

     PHYSICIANS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 602**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1197**].
     
     INDICATION:  77 y/o woman with Crohn's disease status post colonoscopy with
     polypectomy, with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 602**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1197**],
     with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1197**] present and supervising.  The patient was brought to the
     Angiography Suite and placed supine on the table.  The left groin was prepped
     and draped in the usual steile fashion.  The left femoral artery was palpated.
     5 cc of 1% Lidocaine was injected into the subcutaneous tissues of the left
     groin. The left common femoral artery was entered with a 19-gauge single-wall
     needle.
      A .035 [**Last Name (un) 108**] wire was advanced into the aorta.  The needle was exchanged
     for a 5 French sheath.  An Omniflush 4 French catheter was advanced over the
     wire and placed with the tip at the T11 level.  An arteriogram was performed
     at this level.  There was noted to be a widely patent superior mesenteric
     artery but no inferior mesenteric artery was identified.  The catheter was
     repositioned with the tip at the L2 level, and another arteriogram was
     performed.  The catheter was then exchanged for a 5 French Cobra catheter.
     Selective cannulation was made in the SMA.  Another arteriogram was performed
     and revealed extravasation of contrast in a distal branch of the SMA at the
     region of the ileum.  The Cobra catheter was exchanged for a Fast Tracker
     catheter. This catheter was passed into the SMA down to the level of the
     mesenteric border of the loop of bowel at the site of contrast extravasation.
     Embolization was then performed with placement of three 1-cm length Torpedoes.
     This was followed by three 1 cm x 3 mm coils. After the deployment of these
     coils, a selective arteriogram was performed, which revealed no contrast
     extravasation.
      The Tracker catheter was then removed.  The sheath was removed, and
     hemostasis was achieved with 20 minutes of direct compression.
                                                                 (Over)

     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.
     
     INTERPRETATION: 
     
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
     
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     
     Stress images show mild transient ischemic dilatation and a moderate defect of
     the distal anterior wall, apex, and inferolateral wall. 
     
     Resting images show partial reversibility of the above described areas.
     
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 49%.  Hypokinesis of the apex and septum are
     noted on gated wall motion images.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Moderate, partially reversible defect of the distal anterior
     wall, apex, and inferolateral wall.  2) Mild transient ischemic dilatation.  3)

     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     
     77 year old female with known middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and patient's daughter after
     the risks, indications, alternative management.
     
     The patient was brought to the neurointerventional and placed on the table in
     supine position.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
     Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle under local anesthesia with aseptic precautions.  A 035 [**Last Name (un) 108**]
     wire was introduced and the needle taken out.  Over a wire, a 4 FR vascular
     sheath was placed.  Through the sheath, a 4 FR Berenstein 2 catheter was
     placed and after evaluating, the following arteries are selectively
     catheterized.  The distal branches are catheterized after evaluating the
     proximal branches.
     
     The vessels catheterized as are follows:
     
     Right common carotid artery
     
     Right internal carotid artery
     
     Left common carotid artery
     
     Left internal carotid artery
     
     Left vertebral artery
     
     Right vertebral artery

     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     
     77 year old female with known middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and patient's daughter after
     the risks, indications, alternative management.
     
     The patient was brought to the neurointerventional and placed on the table in
     supine position.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
     Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle under local anesthesia with aseptic precautions.  A 035 [**Last Name (un) 108**]
     wire was introduced and the needle taken out.  Over a wire, a 4 FR vascular
     sheath was placed.  Through the sheath, a 4 FR Berenstein 2 catheter was
     placed and after evaluating, the following arteries are selectively
     catheterized.  The distal branches are catheterized after evaluating the
     proximal branches.
     
     The vessels catheterized as are follows:
     
     Right common carotid artery
     
     Right internal carotid artery
     
     Left common carotid artery
     
     Left internal carotid artery
     
     Left vertebral artery
     
     Right vertebral artery

     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     
     77 year old female with known middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and patient's daughter after
     the risks, indications, alternative management.
     
     The patient was brought to the neurointerventional and placed on the table in
     supine position.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
     Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle under local anesthesia with aseptic precautions.  A 035 [**Last Name (un) 108**]
     wire was introduced and the needle taken out.  Over a wire, a 4 FR vascular
     sheath was placed.  Through the sheath, a 4 FR Berenstein 2 catheter was
     placed and after evaluating, the following arteries are selectively
     catheterized.  The distal branches are catheterized after evaluating the
     proximal branches.
     
     The vessels catheterized as are follows:
     
     Right common carotid artery
     
     Right internal carotid artery
     
     Left common carotid artery
     
     Left internal carotid artery

     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     
     77 year old female with known middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and patient's daughter after
     the risks, indications, alternative management.
     
     The patient was brought to the neurointerventional and placed on the table in
     supine position.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
     Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19 gauge single
     wall needle under local anesthesia with aseptic precautions.  A 035 [**Last Name (un) 108**]
     wire was introduced and the needle taken out.  Over a wire, a 4 FR vascular
     sheath was placed.  Through the sheath, a 4 FR Berenstein 2 catheter was
     placed and after evaluating, the following arteries are selectively
     catheterized.  The distal branches are catheterized after evaluating the
     proximal branches.
     
     The vessels catheterized as are follows:
     
     Right common carotid artery
     
     Right internal carotid artery
     
     Left common carotid artery
     
     Left internal carotid artery
     
     Left vertebral artery
     
     Right vertebral artery

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right MCA aneurysm.
     
     CONTRAST:  Head CT followed by contiguous images following and during the
     injection of 150 ml of Optiray 320 with multiple projection reconstruction.
     
     Exam is compared to prior head CT of [**3284-6-20**] and to the patient's angiogram of
     [**3284-6-22**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The ossific lesion in the posterior fossa on the right side, measuring 22 x 15
     mm in dimension, is again identified and is unchanged from the previous exam.
     The parenchyma of the brain is unchanged from previous exam.  There is no
     evidence of territorial infarct or hemorrhage.  There is again soft tissue
     density in the left side of the sphenoid sinus.
     
     CTA:  Aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery trifurcation measuring 6 mm
     in greatest dimension is again identified, similar to the angiogram.  There is
     an infundibulum of the distal aspect of the basilar artery, as identified on
     the angiogram.  There is an unusual contour of the left superior cerebellar
     artery, which appears to be coursing more inferiorly and providing supply to
     AICA territory.  The right transverse and sigmoid sinus, which is subjacent to
     the ossified lesion, most likely representing a meningioma, appears patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Right middle cerebral artery trifurcation aneurysm with features as
     discussed above, similar to the angiogram.
     
     2. The appearance of the distal cerebral artery appears to represent an
     infundibulum, rather than an aneurysm.  The right transverse and sigmoid sinus
     region subjacent to the ossific lesion, thought to represent a meningioma,
     appears patent.

     TECHNIQUE: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15200**] was taken to the angiography suite on [**3284-6-23**] where her
     abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Under
     fluoroscopic guidance her NG tube which was located postpyloric was pulled
     back into the stomach and the residual stomach contents were aspirated and the
     stomach was expanded with air. With visualization of the stomach and small
     intestine, three T-fasteners were inserted via a hollow bore needle after
     administration of 1% lidocaine local anesthesia to secure the stomach in
     place. The stomach was then accessed percutaneously with a hollow bore needle
     and a Bentson guidewire was advanced into the stomach. Administration of small
     amounts of contrast confirmed placement of the fastners and wire in the
     stomach. The needle was then exchanged for a 5 Fr sheath. The [**Last Name (un) 108**] wire was
     then advanced through the pylorus into the distal portion of duodenum. The
     [**Last Name (un) 108**] wire was then exchanged for an Amplatz wire which was advanced into

     right colectomy status post SMA embolization for massive lower GI bleed. After
     stay in MIC was found to have paretic right vocal cord with aspiration
     demonstrated on swallow study. Currently with NG tube. Request for
     percutaneous feeding access.

     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15200**] was taken to the angiography suite on [**3284-6-23**] where her
     abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Under
     fluoroscopic guidance her NG tube which was located postpyloric was pulled
     back into the stomach and the residual stomach contents were aspirated and the
     stomach was expanded with air. With visualization of the stomach and small
     intestine, three T-fasteners were inserted via a hollow bore needle after
     administration of 1% lidocaine local anesthesia to secure the stomach in
     place. The stomach was then accessed percutaneously with a hollow bore needle
     and a Bentson guidewire was advanced into the stomach. Administration of small
     amounts of contrast confirmed placement of the fastners and wire in the
     stomach. The needle was then exchanged for a 5 Fr sheath. The [**Last Name (un) 108**] wire was
     then advanced through the pylorus into the distal portion of duodenum. The
     [**Last Name (un) 108**] wire was then exchanged for an Amplatz wire which was advanced into
     the fourth portion of the duodenum. The 5 Fr sheath was then exchanged for 10
     Fr and 14 Fr dilators. A 14 Fr peelaway sheath was then inserted. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 109**] GJ
     catheter was then inserted through the peelaway sheath. With the Amplatz wire
     the catheter was advanced past the ligament of Treitz through to the proximal
     jejunum. The peelaway sheath was then removed and the Amplatz wire was pulled
     out. The pigtail was then formed in the second portion of the duodenum and
     secured. The tube was then secured with a StatLock and the wound was dried and
     dressed. Final fluoroscopic examination revealed proper placement of the tube
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate for aspiration.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Right vocal paresis.  Evaluate for aspiration.
     
     Multiple swallows were attempted with liquids of varying consistencies.  There
     is moderate residue in both vallecula and pyriform sinuses after swallowing,
     and cued swallows are ineffective in clearing the pyriform sinuses.  During
     swallow of a cookie, the residue from pudding which was in the pyriform
     sinuses was pushed into the cord, which was subsequently aspirated.  On
     attempts of coughing to the clear the cords, the patient actually pulled
     residue from the cued cookie into the trachea on inspiratory effort.  During
     consecutive sips of thin liquids, a small amount of liquid was aspirated due
     to ineffectiveness of cord closure.  All of these episodes of aspirations were
     silent and cued cough was ineffective in clearing.
     
     Please see Speech and Language Pathology report in the notes portion OMR for
     full details, assessment, and recommendations.
