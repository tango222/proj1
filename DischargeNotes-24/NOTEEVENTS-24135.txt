     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      70 year old woman with recent hemorrhagic stroke and multiple bilateral PE with
      RV strain on echo and initially hypotensive.  Lysis and heparin
      contraindicated.  Will need IVC filter. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt with multiple bilateral PE and recent hemorrhagic stroke
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 70 year old woman with acute bilateral pulmonary embolism and a
     recent hemorrhagic stroke precluding anticoagulation.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1196**] and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 188**] d'Othee. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 188**] [**Name (STitle) 189**], the
     Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     The procedure was discussed with the patient's family and informed consent was
     obtained from the husband. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner, and ultrasound examination of the right groin was performed.
     
     Under ultrasound guidance, the right common femoral vein was accessed using a
     19-gauge single-wall needle. A 0.035 guide wire was subsequently advanced into
     the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was then
     exchanged for a 5-French pigtail catheter, the tip of which was positioned in
     the distal right common iliac vein under fluoroscopic guidance. A venacavogram
     was performed in the AP projection.
     
     The pigtail catheter was then exchanged for the IVC filter introducer sheath
     over the guidewire. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-Nitinol filter was then deployed in the infrarenal
     inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.
     
     A post-placement venacavogram was then repeated through the introducer sheath.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure without complication.
     
     MEDICATIONS: A total of 60 cc of IV non-ionic contrast was utilized secondary
     to the patient's history of allergy.
     
     FINDINGS:
     Ultrasound examination of the right groin demonstrated a patent and
     compressible right common femoral vein.
     Venacavogram demonstrated a patent inferior vena cava with single bilateral
     renal vein inflows, and no evidence of caval anomalies.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 70 year old woman with acute bilateral pulmonary embolism and a
     recent hemorrhagic stroke precluding anticoagulation.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1196**] and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 188**] d'Othee. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 188**] [**Name (STitle) 189**], the
     Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     The procedure was discussed with the patient's family and informed consent was
     obtained from the husband. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner, and ultrasound examination of the right groin was performed.
     
     Under ultrasound guidance, the right common femoral vein was accessed using a
     19-gauge single-wall needle. A 0.035 guide wire was subsequently advanced into
     the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was then
     exchanged for a 5-French pigtail catheter, the tip of which was positioned in
     the distal right common iliac vein under fluoroscopic guidance. A venacavogram
     was performed in the AP projection.
     
     The pigtail catheter was then exchanged for the IVC filter introducer sheath
     over the guidewire. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-Nitinol filter was then deployed in the infrarenal
     inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.
     
     A post-placement venacavogram was then repeated through the introducer sheath.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure without complication.
     
     MEDICATIONS: A total of 60 cc of IV non-ionic contrast was utilized secondary
     to the patient's history of allergy.
     
     FINDINGS:
     Ultrasound examination of the right groin demonstrated a patent and
     compressible right common femoral vein.
     Venacavogram demonstrated a patent inferior vena cava with single bilateral
     renal vein inflows, and no evidence of caval anomalies.
                                                                 (Over)

     Post-placement venacavogram demonstrated the filter in an adequate infrarenal

     filter in the infrarenal inferior vena cava via the right femoral vein
     approach.
