Admission Date:  [**3364-12-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**3364-12-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**3283-6-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Trauma

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
white male status post fall down steps.  He was found
unconscious by wife.  He was intubated at the scene and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 4**] via
Med-Flight as a trauma alert.

In the trauma bay the patient was found to have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1300**]
Coma Scale of 6, intubated, which quickly deteriorated to
[**Location (un) 1300**] Coma Scale of 3.  The patient was moving his
extremities spontaneously, though not purposefully.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination his pupils were noted to be reactive at
approximately 3 mm to 4 mm.  Chest examination was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen examination revealed soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Heart had first heart sound and
second heart sound.  A regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities were
warm.  Good distal pulses.  His pelvis was stable.  Rectal
examination was heme-negative.  There was no stepoff noted on
his back examination.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   The patient underwent trauma series, and
was significant for:  Appeared to have a C2 fracture.

His chest x-ray was within normal limits.

Pelvis x-ray was within normal limits.

A CAT scan of the head was significant for a right subdural
hematoma, right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and left
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

A CAT scan of his cervical spine was significant for a C2
fracture.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratory values were
within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was subsequently admitted to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in a hard cervical collar
and was placed on ventilatory support.  During his Surgical
Intensive Care Unit stay the patient's neurologic examination
did not improve.  He was minimally responsive.  He was able
to move his extremities spontaneously but not purposefully.
Then, on [**12-8**], after a repeat CAT scan of his head
which did not show any significant change, after returning
from his CAT scan the patient suddenly desaturated.  His
oxygen saturations dropped to the middle 80s.  He was quickly
put on FIO2 of 100% on the ventilator on maximal ventilatory
support.

Throughout the night it was noted that the patient required a
significant amount of Levophed to maintain his blood
pressure.  The patient was also started on a Pertussin drip
which allowed his Levophed drip to decrease somewhat.  The
patient's urine output was also decreased to minimal, and his
creatinine went from his baseline of 2 to the high 3s.

A renal consultation at that time was called and deemed that
the patient was in likely congestive heart failure and
required aggressive diuresis.  Despite large doses of Lasix,
the patient was unresponsive as far as urine output goes, and
Nephrology decided then to put the patient on continuous
venovenous hemofiltration so he could get some of his fluid
off.  Despite putting the patient on continuous venovenous
hemofiltration, the patient's respiratory status did not
improved.  Moreover, his hemodynamic compromise also did not
improve requiring maximal doses of Levophed as well as
Pertussin.

At that time the family was called, and later in the evening
on [**3364-12-9**], the family decided to withdraw care.
Subsequently, the patient expired in the evening of
[**3364-12-9**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient expired on [**3364-12-9**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Severe intracranial hemorrhage which
included a right subdural hematoma, right intraparenchymal
hematoma, and a left intraparenchymal hematoma.  The patient
also had a C2 fracture.  Also, on a repeat CAT scan, the
patient was noted to have bilateral infiltrates consistent
with bilateral pneumonia.  It was likely that the cause of
the patient's demise was severe sepsis secondary to his
pneumonia.

The patient's family refused a postmortem autopsy, and the
patient was accepted by the medical examiner.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:
     Widened mediastinum status post fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung base to the upper abdomen.
     200 cc of Optiray given. Reconstructions were performed. No procedural
     complications. A noncontrast CT of the chest was also performed.
     
     FINDINGS
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:
     There is vascular calcification throughout the ascending and descending aorta
     consistent with atherosclerotic disease. There is no evidence of active
     extravasation. There is a 3.7 x 2.1 cm soft tissue density seen posterior and
     to the right of the trachea and esophagus. The soft tissue density and showed
     no evidence of enhancement or active extravasation. This probably represents a
     small vessel venous hematoma. This is located in the right paratracheal
     stripe. Small sub-5 mm lymph nodes are identified in the anterior mediastinum
     and pretracheal region. A scan was performed in the venous phase with adequate
     opacification of the pulmonary artery and SVC. There is no evidence of
     extravasation. The trachea and esophagus are unremarkable. There is mild
     enlargement of the heart. There are sternal wires suggesting a previous CABG
     surgery. There is small right-sided pleural effusion. There are atelectases at
     both bases. There is no pneumothorax. There are significant degenerative
     changes of the thoracic spine. There are no fractures of the thoracic spine or
     ribs. There is erosive arthritis of the right shoulder.The extrathoracic soft
     tissues are unremarkable. The evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:
     AORTIC CT- ANGIOGRAPHY show no  acute aortic injury
     
     IMPRESSION:
     There is no evidence of acute injury to the aorta or the major venous
     structures.
     
     Note is made of a right paratracheal hematoma. This measured 3.7 x 2.1 cm in
     its largest dimension.
     
     Findings were discussed with the trauma team at the time of the study. Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 2516**] was present for the entire examination.

     HISTORY:  Cervical fracture after fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the cervical spine without contrast enhancement.
     Sagittal and coronal reformations were also obtained.
     
     There are slightly displaced fractures of the C2 vertebra, involving the base
     of the odontoid process, right portion of the vertebral body, and right
     lateral mass.  Fracture extends through the left transverse foramen.  On the
     right, there may be muld diastasis of the C2-3 facet articulation. There are
     degenerative changes at multiple other levels, but no other cervical fractures
     are identified. There is no spondylolisthesis.
     
     The cervical spinal canal is not narrowed by the fracture.
     
     There are fractures of the right first and left third ribs posteriorly.  There
     are degenerative changes in the upper-thoracic spine, particularly at T3-4,
     where there is a large anterior osteophyte which may be fractured.  There may
     be a mediastinal hematoma and pleural effusions bilaterally.  These findings
     were more fully evaluated on the CT study of the chest.  Endotracheal and
     nasogastric tubes are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Fractures of C2, as described above.

     HISTORY:  Follow-up study in patient with known intracranial hemorrhage and
     facial injury.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3364-12-5**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the foramen magnum to
     the cranial vertex.  Thin sections were obtained through the paranasal sinuses
     axially with coronal and sagittal reformations.
     
     No intravenous contrast was used.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is redemonstration of the bilateral frontal lobe parenchymal
     hemorrhages and the small subdural hematoma overlying the right parietal lobe.
     There is no interval change in appearance of these lesions.  There is no
     interval change in the ventricular dimensions.  There is no evidence of new
     intracranial hemorrhage or shift of midline structures.
     
     Thin section multiplanar reformations through the facial bones reveal no
     evidence of fracture.  The maxillary sinuses are completely opacified.  The
     ethmoid sinuses are nearly completely opacified with the exception of a single
     posterior right air cell.  The right sphenoid sinus is completely opacified.
     The left sphenoid sinus demonstrates mild mucosal thickening.  There is no
     change in the appearance of the paranasal sinuses.  The mastoid air cells are
     pneumatized.  The left frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma is again seen and
     minimally larger than seen in the prior study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Stable appearance of intracranial hemorrhages with no evidence of new
     hemorrhage.
     2.  No evidence of fracture of the facial bones.  Stable appearance of
     paranasal sinuses.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old man with s/p fall down stairs, intubated, head bleeds,
      coagulopathic, renal failure.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      clear thoracic/lumbar/sacral spine, r/o fracture
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient fell down the stairs.
     
     THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE, FIVE VIEWS:  The thoracic spine is poorly evaluated
     on the lateral view due to underpenetration.  No gross fracture is seen in the
     thoracic spine on the frontal view.
     
     The kidneys are dense.  There is lumbar scoliosis with convexity towards the
     left.  There are no fractures or dislocation in the lumbar spine.  There is
     minimal anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.  Large osteophytes project off the
     anterior surface of the upper lumbar vertebral bodies.  There is minimal
     anterolisthesis of L5 on S1, otherwise alignment of the lumbar spine is
     normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Evaluation of the thoracic spine was very limited due to
     underpenetration on the lateral view.  Repeat examination of the thoracic
     spine is recommended if there is still clinical concern about the thoracic
     spine.
     
     2)  There is lumbar scoliosis.  There is no osseous injury of the lumbar
     spine.
     
     3)  Dense nephrograms are present which may be seen with renal failure.
     Clinical correlation is recommended.

     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST AND MULTIPLANAR REFORMATIONS AND CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS
     WITH CONTRAST AND MULTIPLANAR REFORMATIONS.
     
     INDICATION:  Sepsis, abdominal distention and abdominal pain.  Sudden drop in
     O2 saturation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray for indication
     of rapid bolus CTA, CT was performed from the lung apices to the pubic
     symphysis.  Multiplanar reformations were created per CT pulmonary angiography
     protocol and CT abdominal angiography protocol.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  ET tube is in good position.  There has been
     significant interval worsening of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates involving
     the lower lobes and dependent portions of the upper lobes.  Of note, in the
     superior-most portions of the upper lobes, this consolidation describes a
     multifocal rounded appearance, which is somewhat atypical for bacterial
     pneumonia.  The lower lobe consolidations also appear worse in the interval.
     If the patient is failing typical antibiotic therapy, consideration should be
     made to fungal and/or highly-resistant bacterial organisms.  The small
     bilateral effusions are unchanged.  Allowing for limitations of patient
     respiratory motion, the pulmonary arteries are patent without endoluminal
     filling defect to suggest the presence of pulmonary emboli.  The Swan-Ganz
     catheter terminates in the right main pulmonary artery. There are scattered
     mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest of which is in the subcarinal station,
     measuring 14 x 10 mm.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, adrenals and partially-opacified
     abdominal bowel loops are normal in appearance.  Again, there are small
     layering stones within the gallbladder without frank dilation or evidence of
     cholecystitis.  The pancreas is atrophic without focal lesions.  The kidneys
     enhance and excrete symmetrically.  There is a 7.3 x 7.7 cm simple cyst from
     the left inferior renal pole.  The abdominal vessels are patent, without
     significant atherosclerotic disease.  The bowel walls are normal in thickness,
     without evidence of ischemia.  There is a scant amount of ascites, in a
     perihepatic and perisplenic distribution, which is stable in the two-day
     interval.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The pelvic small bowel loops are decompressed. There
     is no convincing evidence for bowel ischemia.  However, there is slight
     increase in the amount of free fluid adjacent to the pelvic bowel loops, of
     uncertain clinical etiology.  The Foley catheter balloon appears to be
     inflated within the prostate proper, unchanged since the [**12-6**] exam.  Query
                                                                 (Over)

     whether the patient is status post prostate surgery.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate severe degenerative rotoscoliosis of the lumbar spine
     and exuberant anterior osteophyte formation with facet degeneration.  A single
     sclerotic focus within the left femoral head is consistent with a bone island.
     
     RECONSTRUCTIONS:  The pulmonary arteries are patent.  There is severe
     consolidation of the dependent portions of all lung lobes.  The abdominal
     vasculature is patent, without evidence of bowel ischemia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Significant interval worsening in bilateral pulmonary consolidations, now
     describing a multifocal rounded appearance.  If the patient is being managed
     with appropriate antibiotics, very resistant bacterial strains or fungal
     etiologies should be considered.  Given the severity of these findings in the
     two-day interval, this is likely the source of the patient's septic
     decompensation.
     
     2) No evidence of pulmonary emboli.
     
     3) Patent abdominal vasculature without evidence of bowel ischemia.
     
     4) No significant change in small amount of abdominal ascites.  The pelvic
     free fluid appears slightly increased in the interval.
     
     5) Foley catheter balloon appears to be inflated within the prostate gland.
     Clinical correlation is recommended.
     
     6) Severe lumbar spine scoliosis and degeneration.
