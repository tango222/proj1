Admission Date:  [**2864-2-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2864-2-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**2781-8-13**]       Sex:  M

Service:  ACOVE
The patient was originally admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit and then transferred to the Acove Service.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5804**] is
an 82-year-old gentleman with an extensive past medical
summary information is as follows:  He was hospitalized
[**2863-12-19**] to [**2863-12-20**] for a G-tube placement secondary to
difficulty swallowing and chronic aspiration.  This was done
without complication.

He had a workup in [**10/2863**] for worsening dyspnea, and his sputum
grew Mycobacterium avium complex and given the patient's wasting
treatment for [**Doctor First Name **] with ethambutol 400 mg b.i.d., Ofloxacin
200 mg b.i.d. and azithromycin 250 mg b.i.d.

He continued to have worsening respiratory distress, dyspnea on
exertion, with minimal activity and the Lasix he was on
chronically was was increased from 80 mg to 120 mg q.d. by his
Cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Hospital6 3163**].  The hematocrit was noted to be 26 at that time and he
was transfused two units packed red blood cells without any
relief. He continued dyspnea with minimal exertion, such as
dressing himself. Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg and also continuing the
Lasix at 120 mg q.d. He was then changed to Torsinide and
Zaroxolyn over the past several days prior to admission on
the [**12-6**].

Per the patient, on the day of admission he felt ""rough"".  He
complained of decreased urine output for approximately one
week.  Also, he complained of decreased energy with waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 501**] mental status over the past week by report from his
daughter.  The patient has a stable chronic cough, which is
productive of white sputum.  He has stable shortness of breath
and dyspnea on exertion and also orthopnea, as well as lower
extremity edema.  He had been gaining weight the several weeks
prior to admission.  He increased from 120 pounds to 140
pounds, and he and his family attributed this to the G tube
feedings that he was getting.

or abdominal pain.  He did report intermittent diarrhea and
constipation, as well as difficulty swallowing.  No palpitations,
no dysuria noted.

lobular opacity of bilateral lung fields, right peribronchial
ground-glass opacities, as well as diffuse severe emphysema,
calcified right middle lobe granuloma.  The EKG showed a
paced rhythm, rate 100, intermittent atrial pacing with a
left bundle branch block morphology.

SUMMARY:  This is an 82-year-old gentleman with a very
extensive past medical history.  The patient was admitted on
the [**11-4**] to the Intensive Care Unit for
progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, as well as
anemia.  He was admitted with acute renal failure, anemia, as
well as congestive heart failure exacerbation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by issue)

#1.  The patient was in the Intensive Care Unit from the [**11-4**] through the [**11-8**].  Summary of the MICU
course, which is an abbreviated summary, is as follows:  For
acute renal failure he was gently hydrated and transfused.
He was followed by the renal team.  It was felt that he had a
prerenal azotemia due to his heart failure.  Foley catheter
was placed to follow inputs and outputs.  Weights were
followed.  Electrolytes were followed closely.  The renal
function gradually improved, such that, at the time of
transfer to the medical floor his creatinine decreased to
1.2.  He was diuresed with IV Lasix and also with Zaroxolyn.
He was then transitioned to p.o. Lasix and Zaroxolyn by the
time he was transferred to the medical floor.  On the [**11-8**], he was off standing diuretics.  However, Acetazolamide
was intermittently used at 125 mg p.o.q.d. for elevated
bicarbonate.  The patient, upon arrival to the medical floor,
continued to have daily weights followed, as well as
electrolytes followed.  The goal was for him to have his
fluid intake and output even.  The patient will plan to be
discharged with Foley catheter in place.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient had an echocardiogram
done on [**2864-2-5**], which showed EF 30%to 35% as well as ASD
with left-to-right flow, decreased LV function compared to
[**2861-11-26**], however, improvement of his mitral
regurgitation.

The congestive heart failure was treated with gentle diuresis
as previously mentioned.  He was stable when he arrived to
the medical floor.  He was continued on Cozaar and Digoxin.
Digoxin level was initially 2.2.  It was held while he was in
the Intensive Care Unit and restarted when he came to the
medical floor.

PULMONARY:  The patient does have a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  He was continued on Flovent,
Serevent, and Combivent.  He was noted to have bilateral
effusions, thought secondary to congestive heart failure.  At
baseline, the oxygen requirement is approximately 4 liters
via nasal cannula.  Pulmonary status was not felt to be due
to a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare and,
therefore, steroids were not initiated during this hospital
course.  As mentioned, the shortness of breath and the
dyspnea on exertion were thought to be secondary to
congestive heart failure exacerbation and not to chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  Pulmonary status
was completely stable while he was on the medical floor
requiring 2 units to 4 units of oxygen via nasal cannula.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient completed a course of
antibiotics for [**Doctor First Name **], including Ethambutol, Ofloxacin and
Azithromycin.  That course was completed on the [**2864-2-7**].  He was continued on his HIV medications
including Nevirapine and Combivir during his hospital course.
 He was also started on Ciprofloxacin 250 q.d. for a ten-day
course in response to a [**2-4**] wound culture, which grew out
pansensitive Pseudomonas.  The patient remained afebrile
while he was on the medical floor.

ANEMIA:  The patient has a multifactorial anemia, including
iron-deficiency anemia, B12 deficiency, as well as anemia of
chronic disease.  He was continued on Procrit and B12.  He
was transfused in the Intensive Care Unit.  However, he did
not require any blood transfusions on the medical floor.  The
goal was to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 owing to his
coronary artery disease.  The patient will be continued on
his Procrit and monthly B12 injections, following discharge.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient initially
presented with hyponatremia and he was fluid restricted while
he was in the Intensive Care Unit.  Following aggressive
diuresis then he became hypernatremic and he was treated with
free-water boluses.  He has chronically elevated bicarbonate
secondary to metabolic compensation for a respiratory
acidosis, as well as a metabolic alkalosis owing to
aggressive diuresis during this hospital stay.  The patient
was intermittently put on Acetazolamide 125 mg p.o.q.d. for
the elevated bicarbonate.  In terms of his nutrition, he
continued to be on Respalor at 60 cc per hour and he was on
aspiration precautions.  Potassium was repleted as needed.
The electrolytes, including the entire Chem 10 panel was
followed daily with repletion made accordingly.

PAIN:  The patient was continued on his Fentanyl patch at 25
mcg q.72h. as well as Percocet and Neurontin.  In terms of
neurological, the patient was continued on Sinemet for his
Parkinson's disease.  In terms of prophylaxis, the patient
was continued on Prevacid and subcutaneous heparin.

At the time of discharge, the active medical issues on him
are the following:  Following sodium for the hypernatremia,
as mentioned, as well as following the bicarbonate for the
elevated bicarbonate owing to a combination of respiratory
acidosis with a compensatory metabolic alkalosis, as well as
contraction alkalosis; also continuing to follow his volume
status such that he is even for his intake and output every
day.  Free water boluses given as necessary to keep him even
from a volume standpoint.

RENAL:  BUN and creatinine are stable at this time.
Pulmonary-wise, he has stable oxygen saturation on two liters
via nasal cannula.  We are continuing with his MDIs.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is hemodynamically stable.  We
are continuing the Cozaar, Digoxin and Pravachol.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient has not had any temperature
spikes.  We will continue his HIV medications, Combivir, and
the Nevirapine, as well as a Cipro for a ten-day course.  The
end date is [**2864-2-18**].  This is for the Pseudomonas in his
wound.  Culture date is [**2-4**].  From a hematology standpoint,
he is continued on Procrit and he will get monthly B12 shots.
From a pain standpoint, he will continue on the Fentanyl
patch and the Neurontin.  From a neurological standpoint, he
will continue on the Sinemet.
