Attending:[**Known patient firstname 1425**] 
Chief Complaint:
Substernal chest pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization on [**3040-2-22**]:
EF 45%
Cypher stent to mid LAD
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 year old male with a history of CAD s/p 2 
prior MIs but no CABG or stents, history of 35-40 years of 
tobacco with COPD, HTN and HL who presented to [**Hospital3 **] 
via ambulance on [**3040-2-22**] after experiencing [**11-28**] substernal 
chest pain. The patient had been getting ready for bed when he 
experienced nausea and vomiting x  diaphoresis and shortness of 
breath. He then experienced [**11-28**] substernal chest pain that was 
similar to his prior angina but much more severe. The pain 
radiated down his left arm. He took 2 SL nitros at home without 
relief and his wife called 911 and thus taken by ambulance to 
[**Hospital3 **]. In the ambulance, he was in atrial fibrillation 
and then suffered a vfib arrest and was shocked three times and 
went into torsades. The patient was then loaded with 150 mg IV 
amio and started on an amio gtt. At [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have 
2-[**Street Address 976**] elevations V2-V6. He was placed on Aggrastat, Plavix, 
Lopressor, Amio gtt at 1 mg, nitro gtt and morphine and Mg 2 mg. 
 The nitro was increased to 70 mcg/hr and the patient states he 
became pain free. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 25**] for cath. 

Cardiac Cath [**3040-2-22**]:

ECHO Study Date of [**3040-2-25**]   

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% (nl >=55%)
 Conclusions:  
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are  
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular  
systolic function is moderately depressed with akinesis of the 
distal septum  
and apex and severe hypokinesis of the inferior and 
infero-lateral walls. The  
basal anterior, antero-septal and lateral walls move best. Right 
ventricular  
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3)  
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace 
aortic  
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There  
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is  
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial  
effusion.  
  
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w 
multivessel CAD.  

C.CATH Study Date of [**3040-2-22**]   

COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a left dominant 
system with 
two vessel CAD. The LMCA had no angiographic evidence of 
coronary artery 
disease. The LAD had a discrete distal 95% stenosis, which was 
stented 
(see below).  The LCX was large and dominant.  It gave off a 
large OM1 
branch and a large OM 2 branch. The OM2 branch had a 70% 
stenosis 
proximally. The RCA was small and non-dominant. It did not have 
any 
angiographically apparent CAD. 
2. Hemodynamics performed after the intervention revealed 
elevated left 
and right heart pressures and a preserved cardiac index. 
3. Left ventriculography revealed anterolateral, apical and 
inferoapical 
akinesis.  There was no mitral regurgitation. Calculated EF was 
44%. 
4. Successful direct stenting of the mid-LAD with a 3.0 x 18 mm 
Cypher 
DES. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no 
apparent 
dissection, and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments). 
5. Successful closure of the right common femoral arteriotomy 
with a 6 
French Angioseal device. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Mild systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 
3. Acute myocardial infarction treated by primary PCI with 
placement of 
a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LAD. 
4. Successful Angioseal. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 73 year old male with a history of CAD s/p 2 
prior MIs with HTN and COPD who presented with an anterior STEMI 
c/b vfib arrest

1. CAD
- The patient had suffered a large anterior STEMI complicated by 
V. fib arrest in the ambulance ride to the hospital. He had a 
Cypher stent placed to his mid-LAD and suffered no more chest 
pain.
-The patient was originally started on ASA, aggrastat, Plavix 
and a statin. He was also placed on heparin due to akinesis of 
the apex. However, the patient developed a subsequent voluminous 
GI bleed and required 2 units of blood. He had reported bright 
red blood per rectum as an outpatient given his history of 
rectal carcinoma. As a result, the aggrastat and heparin were 
discontinued. Although the patient would benefit from coumadin 
due to his akinetic apex, it was decided not to initiate 
long-term anticoagulation as he did not tolerate this well. He 
should have a repeat echo in 4 weeks to reassess his wall motion 
and EF.
- He was placed on metoprolol 25 mg BID and Lisinopril 5 mg.

2. CHF EF 45%
- The patient remained euvolemic during his stay.
- He had a repeat echo on [**3040-2-25**] which showed persistent 
akinesis of the distal septum and apex with an EF of 30%.
- He was started on an ACE for cardiac remodeling.

3. HTN
- The patient takes Norvasc 5 mg and Imdur 30 mg at home. We 
started Metoprolol 25 mg BID and Lisinopril 5 mg. His systolic 
blood pressure on presentation was in the 120s but remained in 
the 100s during the rest of his stay. He denied feeling dizzy or 
lightheaded and did well with PT. 

4. COPD
- The patient has a history of spontaneous pneumothoraces 
secondary to bullous lung disease. We continued the patient's 
outpatient inhaler regimen. He remained stable.

5. Gastrointestinal bleed
- The morning after presentation on aggrastat and heparin as 
well as plavix, the patient developed a large acute GIB with 
bright red blood per rectum. He denied any abdominal pain. The 
heparin and aggrastat were discontinued and he was transfused 
with 2 units of blood. The patient has a history of anorectal 
carcinoma s/p chemo and radiation in [**3031**]. GI and surgery were 
consulted and both recommended conservative management. The 
patient states that he had a reportedly normal colonoscopy 2 
months ago at an outside hospital ([**Doctor First Name 4459**]). However, we felt that 
his GI bleed was either from recurrent anorectal carcinoma or 
radiation proctitis. The patient will need another colonoscopy 
soon to confirm this. He also reports a recent 12 pound weight 
loss.
- The patient thereafter, reported no GI bleeds and remained 
hemodynamically stable.

6. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia
- The patient had runs of NSVT on telemetry during his stay. He 
also exhibited atrial ectopic activity on EKG giving an 
irregular heart beat. Given his low EF, EP was asked to evaluate 
the patient for a question of an ICD. However, EP felt that he 
required a full GI workup to determine if he had recurrent 
rectal carcinoma and if so, determine his prognosis before they 
implanted an ICD with mortality benefits in the year following 
an MI. This would require an inpatient repeat colonoscopy. The 
patient decided against staying in the hospital to have a 
complete GI workup as he recently had a colonoscopy at [**Doctor First Name 4459**]. 
Instead, the patient decided to meet with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2070**], his 
outpatient cardiologist early the following week to discuss 
whether an ICD should be placed. 

7. Dispo - The patient was seen by PT who recommended home PT. 
The patient qualifies for [**Hospital3 2**] free care and case management 
believed he would benefit from outpatient rehabilitation.
