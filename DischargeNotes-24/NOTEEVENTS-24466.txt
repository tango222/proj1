     INDICATION:  60 year old man with CLL.
     
     COMPARISON:  MRI of the brain dated [**2562-8-25**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 images were obtained of the head. Diffusion-
     weighted and T1-weighted post gadolinium images were also obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are new enhancing masses of decreased T2 signal present along
     the ependymal margins of the posterior horns of both the right and left
     lateral ventricles and extending into the posterior corpus callosum, which are
     surrounded by areas of increased T2 signal, and consistent with
     lymphomatous/leukemic masses with edema. The edema in the right side of the
     brain extends from the posterior right parietal region to the right temporal
     subcortical white matter.  This is increased compared to the prior study.
     There is no hydrocelphalus.
     Also noted is abnormal marrow signal of the vertebral bodies that may be
     related to the patient's known history of CLL. Cervical lymphadenopathy is
     also demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New enhancing masses located along the posterior horns of the
     lateral ventricles and involving the posterior corpus callosum that are
     concerning for CNS lymphoma or chloromas.

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5210**] 
Chief Complaint:
Tonic-Clonic seizures and left sided weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic placement of jejunostomy tube
 
History of Present Illness:
60 yo M w/ h/o CLL and CNS lymphoma admitted on [**2562-10-11**] s/p 
seizure x 3 at rehab.  He is a patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The 
patient initially presented in [**2557**] with an increased WBC found 
during a pre-op workup for a hernia repair.  Further workup 
found this to be CLL and the patient was treated with a cycle of 
chlorambucil and prednisone finished in [**2562-7-15**].  

The patient was doing well until [**2-14**] when he presented with 
mild ataxia and memory problems. A sterotactic biospy of his 
right parietal lesion revealed a B-cell lymphoproliferative 
disorder with evidence of demylination though was not diagnostic 
of lymphoma. He underwent 2 cycles of CHOP/rituxan but 
progressed. He was thus tried on high dose MTX x 2 to 3 cycles. 
This was c/b ARF and the onset of seizures. He continued to 
progress on this course of treatment and was thus tried on a 
course of total brain irradiation from [**2562-6-24**] to [**2562-8-5**] for 
a total of 6,000 cGy. An attempt was made to wean his Decadron 
post-tx but was c/b L focal motor seizure. 

Further imaging revealed possibly progressive dz. Stereotactic 
brain bx [**2562-10-6**] c/b postop sz confirmed his dx of high-grade B 
Cell lymphoma (CD20+ lymphoma, labs to determine if EBV-related 
are pending). He was d/c [**2562-10-8**] to [**Hospital1 **], unfortunately 
off his lamictal. The morning of [**2562-10-11**], he suffered 3 
generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was brought to the ER. 
There his medication error was recognized and his lamictal was 
restarted. He was admitted on [**2562-10-11**] for re-imaging and 
treatment. 

During this admission, the patient continued to have seizures 
involving his left side. However, [**2562-10-13**] and [**2562-10-14**], he 
became more confused and lethargic, and have myoclonic movements 
of his right arm. He was then transferred to the ICU for close 
monitoring. An EEG in the ICU showed no evidence of seizure 
acitivity and then he was transferred back to the floor. 

Regarding his lymphoma, a repeat head MRI on [**2562-10-11**] has shown 
interval worseining of his mass. He has completed his 3rd cycle 
of rituxan and ara-c on [**2562-10-18**].  
 
Past Medical History:
1. CLL: dx '[**57**] when he was noted to have an elevated wbc on 
preop labs for a hernia repair, 1st tx in 10/02 w/ chlorambucil 
and prednisone for NS, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly  
2. hypercholesterolemia  
3. CNS lymphoma - see hx above  
4. GERD  
PSHx:  
1. s/p stereotactic brain biopsy [**2562-2-24**] and [**2562-10-6**]  
2. s/p ear surgery  
3. s/p hernia repair in [**2557**].  

 
Social History:
No EtOH, tob, drugs. Up until 1 week ago he was living alone, 
completely independent in a 5th floor apartment. He was spending 
a lot of time at his home in [**State 311**] with his girlfriend. Since 
his sz following the brain bx ([**2562-10-6**]), he has been at 
[**Hospital3 693**].  
He worked in a brokerage firm in the past. He is divorced w/ 3 
children (2 daughters in [**Name2 (NI) 439**], 1 son in [**Name2 (NI) **], CO)

MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2562-10-11**] 7:55 PM
Status post biopsy. Increasing extent of enhancement of the mass 
lesions present at the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles 
and splenium of the corpus callosum, with mass effect producing 
a mild right to left shift.
------------

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2562-10-11**] 11:02 AM
Again identified are numerous periventricular masses. These are 
slightly hyperdense on this non-contrast study. This appearance 
has not changed since the examination of [**2562-10-6**]. There is 
massive surrounding edema with mass effect on the ventricles and 
right to left mid-line shift. This has increased slightly since 
the prior study. There is no evidence of hemorrhage in the 
interval. There is a small amount of air at the biopsy site. 
This now demonstrates an air fluid level, which is new since the 
prior study.

CONCLUSION: S/P biopsy of multiple bilateral deep white matter 
masses. There is no evidence of hemorrhage. Again identified are 
numerous masses with massive edema and right to left mid-line 
shift. There has been a slight increase in right hemispheric 
edema since the prior study. 
-------------

EEG Study Date of [**2562-10-15**] 
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of a 
slow and disorganized background rhythm in the delta frequency 
range 
with generalized bursts of delta and theta frequency slowing. 
These 
findings suggest an encephalopathy. Mixed theta and delta 
frequency 
slowing was also noted to be more prominant at times over the 
right 
peri-central region. This finding suggests subcortical 
dysfunction in 
the right posterior frontal and parietal regions. No 
epileptiform 
activity was seen during the recording. Note was made of ectopy 
on the 
cardiac monitor. 
-------------

EEG Study Date of [**2562-10-16**] 
This is an abnormal discontinuous 24-hour bedside telemetry. 
At the beginning of the record, the background rhythm appeared 
slow and 
disorganized in the 3 Hz delta frequency range. There were 
generalized 
bursts of delta frequency slowing and at times the slowing 
appeared more 
prominent in the right parietal region. The findings are 
suggestive of 
encephalopathy and there may also be a subcortical region of 
dysfunction 
in the right parietal region. As the record progressed, the 
background 
rhythm did increase in frequency at times reaching the upper 
theta 
frequency range. There was a brief period of delta frequency 
slowing in 
the right parietal region that did have some sharp features. No 
clear 
epileptiform activity was seen. Also, at times during the 
record, some 
higher frequency activity and slightly higher amplitude was 
noted over 
the right pareital temporal region. This suggests a subcortical 
dysfunction in this region and could reflect a breach rhythm. It 
was 
made on the cardiac monitor and occasional ectopy. No clear 
seizure 
activity was seen during this recording. 
-------------

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2562-10-17**] 4:57 PM
1. Numerous masses with massive edema, minimally increased from 
the prior
study, and consistent with a known history of CNS lymphoma.
2. Persistent right-to-left midline shift, not significantly 
changed.
3. No new intracranial hemorrhage.
-------------

MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2562-10-22**] 7:09 PM
No significant interval change in extent and appearances of the 
enhancing component of the lesion involving the splenium and 
periatrial region of both lateral ventricles compared with the 
prior study of [**2562-10-11**]. No new lesions are identified. The 
examination is slightly limited by motion.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
60M CLL, CNS lymphoma diagnosed in [**2562-2-11**] status post 
multiple treatments now with progressive disease and increasing 
seizure frequency.

1. Seizures:  Patient was initially admitted for seizure 
management and was given lorazepam as needed to terminate 
seizures.  Following rituxan and high-dose AraC therapy, patient 
began to experience twitching of his left lower extremity, which 
he and his family thought were the prodromal effects of 
seizures.  Therefore, although patient was initially managed on 
the floor, he was then transferred to the unit for concern of 
status epilepticus and frequent neurological exams.

Following two EEGs, it was determined that patient was not in 
fact in status, and that sedative medications should be 
minimized.  Dilantin was titrated to a serum level of 19-20, and 
Lamictal was continued and no further seizures were noted.

2. CNS lymphoma:  Patient was initially treated with rituxan and 
high-dose AraC for the synergy.  Cerebral edema was managed with 
standing dexamethasone with intermittent increases as needed.  
However, despite treatment and lack of change on repeat MRI, 
patient's mental status began to worsen.  Although patient was 
initially able to respond verbally with full-length sentences, 
at the time of discharge, patient was completely unable to 
respond to verbal stimuli and was only able to respond to 
noxious stimuli.  Since there was no gross change on repeat MRI, 
it was thought that patient's disease continued to progress on a 
microscopic level that was not visualized by MRI.  Further 
chemotherapy was felt to be futile.  Therefore, near the end of 
the [**Hospital 874**] hospital course, a family meeting was held and it 
was decided that patient would be taken to his home in [**State 311**] for 
hospice care.  In preparation, patient underwent endoscopic 
placement of a jejunostomy tube for continued PO medications 
(especially anti-epileptics).

At the time of discharge, patient's prognosis was poor given the 
progression of his disease despite chemo/biological therapy, and 
it was felt that patient would benefit from hospice care.  
Patient was taken home to [**State 311**] with hospice nursing care.  
Patient's family was instructed to contact the hospital if they 
needed further assistance with management of palliative 
medications.

     COMPARISON:  MR of the head dated [**2562-10-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images of the head were obtained.
     Diffusion weighted images and T1w post Gadolinium images were also obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     An air fluid level is present at the biopsy site.  The mass lesions seen at
     the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, also involving the splenium of
     the corpus callosum demonstrate interval increase in the extent of
     enhancement.  The extent of surrounding edema appears grossly unchanged.
     Although the study is limited by motion artifact, there appears to be a mild
     right to left shift of the septum pellucidum, and right lateral ventricle.
     There is no abnormal signal seen on diffusion weighted images.  The area of
     the biopsy demonstrates susceptibility artifact consistent with air or
     hemorrhage.  There are no new focal areas of abnormal enhancement.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Status post biopsy.  Increasing extent of enhancement of the mass lesions
     present at the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles and splenium of the
     corpus callosum, with mass effect producing a mild right to left shift.

     HISTORY:  Seizures 5 days S/P brain biopsy.
     
     Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast was
     administered.  Comparison to a head CT of [**2562-10-6**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again identified are numerous periventricular masses.  These are
     slightly hyperdense on this non-contrast study.  This appearance has not
     changed since the examination of [**2562-10-6**].  There is massive surrounding edema
     with mass effect on the ventricles and right to left mid-line shift.  This has
     increased slightly since the prior study.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage
     in the interval.  There is a small amount of air at the biopsy site. This now
     demonstrates an air fluid level, which is new since the prior study.
     
     CONCLUSION:  S/P biopsy of multiple bilateral deep white matter masses.  There
     is no evidence of hemorrhage.  Again identified are numerous masses with
     massive edema and right to left mid-line shift. There has been a slight
     increase in right hemispheric edema since the prior study.

     FINDINGS:  Again enhancing lesion is identified involving the periventricular
     region and splenium of corpus callosum with extension to the septum extension
     for the region of fornix.  There is extensive edema seen in both parietal
     occipital region predominantly on the right side.  The previously seen air
     within the lesion secondary to biopsy in the right parietal lobe has resolved.
      There has been no significant interval change in the extent of enhancement
     and edema compared to the prior study.  No new areas of enhancement are
     identified. A small subdural collection possibly post-surgical is seen on the
     right side.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in extent and appearances of the
     enhancing component of the lesion involving the splenium and periatrial region
     of both lateral ventricles compared with the prior study of [**2562-10-11**].  No new
     lesions are identified.  The examination is slightly limited by motion.

     Reason: Please evaluate for new intracranial pathology              
     Admitting Diagnosis: BRAIN TUMOR
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        60 year old man w/ CNS lymphoma s/p brain bx [**10-6**] now with sudden change in 
      mental status. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for new intracranial pathology                                  
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  60-year-old with CNS lymphoma status-post brain biopsy 3 weeks
     ago with sudden change in mental status.  Evaluate for new intracranial
     pathology.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2562-10-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast Head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no change from the prior study.  Again, there are numerous
     periventricular masses which are slightly hyperattenuating on this noncontrast
     study.  These involve the corpus callosum and periventricular white matter and
     do cross the midline.  There is extensive low attenuation in the subcortical
     white matter involving the entirety of the right temporal and parietal lobes,
     and to a lesser extent the right frontal and left temporal and occipital
     lobes representing edema.  There is stable midline shift towards the left.
     There is no evidence of intra- or extraaxial hemorrhage.
     
     Motion limits the exam.  There are polyps vs. retension cysts in both
     maxillary sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No change from prior.
