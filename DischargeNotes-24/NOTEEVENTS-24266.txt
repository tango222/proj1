AnGap-7

[**1-15**] EKG: Baseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm with a 
single. Vertical axis. Right bundle-branch block. Since the 
previous tracing of [**3458-1-11**] decreased QRS voltage in leads VI-V2 
may be related to lead position 

Radiology
[**1-14**] right hip plain films: The distal femoral component of the 
THA is excluded from intraoperative frontal film. There has been 
placement of a right total hip arthroplasty with a cemented 
acetabular and femoral component. On this single AP view, 
components are aligned.

[**1-15**] CXR: No pneumonia or CHF. Subtle increased interstitial 
markings at the bases are unchanged

[**1-19**] CT Abdomen: Moderate-sized hematoma with residual air 
pockets from recent surgery adjacent to right hip prosthesis. No 
extension with into the retroperitoneum or more inferiorly into 
the thigh. Bilateral small pleural effusions, mild subcutaneous 
edema diffusely and some collection of fluid within the 
perirectal fat. Findings consistent with mild anasarca.
Stable bilateral adrenal adenomas

[**1-20**] CT Chest: The heart size is normal. Extensive aortic and 
coronary calcifications are identified. There is no axillary, 
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Evaluation of the lung 
parenchyma is somewhat limited by respiratory motion. Again seen 
are numerous small pulmonary nodules which are stable back to 
2003. Scattered tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 5012**] opacities are also unchanged. There 
are moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Visualized portions of 
the upper abdomen are stable with fullness of the adrenal glands 
again noted. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous 
lesions. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted. 
Right proximal humeral enchondroma or bone infarct is again 
noted.

[**1-25**] KUB/upright: There is no evidence of free intra-abdominal 
air. Normal bowel gas [**Doctor Last Name 5013**] seen. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is 
identified. There is unchanged appearance of a right prosthetic 
hip. High-density material overlying the L5 vertebral body 
unchanged and likely represents a prior history of 
vertebroplasty.

[**1-25**] CXR: No evidence of pneumonia. Stable small bilateral 
pleural effusions.

Pathology
[**1-14**] right hip: The articular surface of the bone appears 
focally eburnated with small osteophyte formation of which 
representative sections are submitted in A-B. Decalcified.

Transthoracic echochardiogram [**3458-1-19**]: EF 50%. Mid inferior 
(and probable inferolateral) hypokinesis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen, [**2-9**]+ MR. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old male initially admitted to the medical ICU with 
hypotenstion following a right total hip replacement. He was 
stabilized and transferred to the general medical floor 
[**3458-1-18**]. His hospital course was notable for NSTEMI, right 
hip/left groin hematomas, atrial fibrillation, and diarrhea 
(likely C. diff).

1) Hypotension: The patient's post-op hypotension was most 
likely secondary to NSTEMI (see below) and peri-op blood loss. 
His blood pressure stabilized and, at time of discharge, his sbp 
was 120s.

2) Coronary artery disease with NSTEMI: The patient's troponin 
peaked at 0.27 on [**3458-1-17**]. An echocardiogram was obtained, 
which showed an EF 50% (down from pre-op PMIBI 66%) with mid 
inferior and probable inferolateral hypokinesis. The cardiology 
service was consulted, who recommended medical management. He 
was started on high dose statin, continued on beta-blocker 
(sotolol), and aspirin. He will follow-up with his cardiologist 
as an outpatient.  

3) Supraventricular tachycardia: The patients telemetry 
monitoring showed a predominantly sinus rhythm with PVCs and 
occasional runs of atrial fibrillation/flutter along with rare 
4-5 beats of NSVT. His sotalol dose was increased to 80 mg daily 
with improved rate control.
  
4) Mental status change: The cause of the patient's poor mental 
status, which was clearing by time of discharge, was likely 
multifactorial - delirium due to multiple acute illnesses 
(diarrhea, recent surgery/anesthesia, pain) superimposed on his 
underlying dementia. The patient was restarted on Namenda and 
Donepezil. Vitamin B12, RPR, and TSH were within normal limites. 
The patient was very sensitive to narcotics, and, on the evening 
of [**3458-1-21**] required multiple doses of Narcan for depressed 
mental status. At time of discharge, his pain was controlled on 
standing tylenol with tramadol as needed. 

5) Right hip and left groin hematomas: These developed while the 
patient had a supratherapeutic INR. He required 2 tranfusions of 
PRBC (last [**1-22**]), and his INR was reversed with vitamin K and 
FFP. His hematocrit remained stable (34.4 on discharge), and he 
was restarted on coumadin. His hematocrit will need to be 
closely monitored as an outpatient, particularly while he is 
anticoagulated.

6) Anemia: This was likely due to peri-operative bleeding as 
well as to the hematomas mentioned above. The patient was 
transfused 6 units of blood in the immediate post-op period, 
followed by 2 units of blood (the last [**1-22**]) when he developed 
the above hematomas. Further work-up included iron studies (not 
consistent with deficiency, vitamin B12/folate (not deficient), 
haptoglobin (not consistent with hemolysis), SPEP/UPEP 
(negative), and fibrinogen (not consistent with DIC). His 
hematocrit on discharge was stable at 34.4. He will need to have 
his hematocrit monitored closely (especially while he is 
anticoagulated).

7) Right total hip replacement: The patient was followed by the 
orthopedics service throughout his hospital stay. He will be 
maintained on coumadin (goal INR 2-2.5) for a total of 6 weeks 
from surgery (4 additional weeks following discharge). He was 
briefly on Keflex given serosanguinous drainage from the right 
hip incision site, which was discontinued once the incision was 
dry. He will follow-up 1 week following discharge for staple 
removal.

8) Diarrhea: The patient developed copious diarrhea while 
in-house. He was started on empiric metronidazole for suspected 
C. diff with good effect, although C. diff A toxin was negative 
X 5. C. diff toxin B is pending at discharge. Given clinical 
improvement, he will continue metronidazole for a 14 day course 
for presumed C. difficile colitis.

9) COPD: The patient was continued on albuterol/atrovent and 
flovent. He remained stable on his home O2 (2 liters).

10) Chronic [**Doctor First Name **]: The patient was continued on azithromycin.

11) Urinary retention: The patient failed multiple voiding 
trials while in-house (most recent Foley placed [**3458-1-27**]). He 
was started on Flomax and should have a repeat voiding trial at 
rehab.
