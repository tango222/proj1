     CT OF THE ABDOMEN [**3258-8-22**].
     
     INDICATION:  History of metastatic ovarian cancer status post resection.
     Abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast.  Coronally
     reformatted images were created.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc of Optiray were administered intravenously due to the
     patient's debility; there were no complications.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are no pleural effusions.
     A focal opacity at the posterior right lung base is adjacent to what appears
     to be a metastatic lesion invading the liver capsule; this lesion probably
     extends through the diaphragm.  Several similar low attenuation lesions with
     peripheral enhancement are seen studding the surface of the liver.  There is
     an NG tube within the contrast filled stomach.  Contrast fills a nondilated
     proximal small bowel.  A prominent dilated loop of small bowel is seen in the
     lower abdomen adjacent to the bladder, containing fecal-like material.  There
     is abrupt narrowing of one end of this small bowel loop adjacent to a
     peripherally enhancing metastatic deposit within the mesentery.  Several other
     dilated small bowel loops are seen nearby.
     
     Innumerable large and small peripherally enhancing nodules are dispersed
     throughout the mesentery and adjacent to bowel loops.  The periphery of the
     spleen also contains multiple round peripherally enhancing lesions consistent
     with metastases.  The pancreas and kidneys are normal in appearance.  Several
     enhancing lesions within the para-aortic retroperitoneum may represent
     metastatic nodes or masses.  The large bowel is dilated to a point just
     proximal to the ostomy.  There is a small amount of ascites within the
     abdomen.  No free air is seen within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a large heterogeneously
     enhancing presacral mass which lies anterior to the Hartmann's pouch.
     
     Coronally reformatted images confirm the above findings.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No lytic or blastic lesions are seen.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Metastatic ovarian CA with metastatic disease to the peritoneum.
     Unable to tolerate PO intake.  Needs double-lumen PICC line for TPN.  Please
     exchange PICC line placed by IV Therapy.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 430**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**], Attending Radiologist
     was present and supervised the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Informed signed consent was obtained from the patient through a
     Portuguese interpreter.  The right upper extremity was prepped in standard
     sterile fashion.  A .018 glide wire was passed through the existing PICC line
     and advanced into the SVC.  Then the PICC line was exchanged over the wire for
     a 4 French introducer sheath.  Following this, the glide wire was removed and
     a .018 guide wire with markings was advanced under fluoroscopy into the SVC.
     Based on the markers on the guide wire it was determined that a length of 46
     cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to this length and advanced
     over a 5 French introducer sheath under fluorscopic guidance into the SVC. The
     sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed.
     
     FINDINGS:  A final chest x-ray demonstrates a PICC line entering from the
     right with the tip in the distal SVC.  Additionally, an NG is noted on the
     radiograph.
     
     The line is ready for use.  There is good blood flow through both reports. A
     Stat-lock was applied and the lines was hep-locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange of a 46 cm total length 5 French double-lumen
     PICC line with the tip in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.

     present and supervised the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: Informed and signed consent was obtained from the patient through a
     Portugese interpreter. The left upper abdomen was prepped and draped in usual
     fashion. After local anesthesia with 1% Lidcaine and observation of stomach
     insufflation under fluorscopy, two T-fasteners were inserted into the anterior
     abdominal wall through the stomach. In between the T-fasteners, a needle was
     inserted and a .035 guidewire was advanced into the stomach under fluoroscopic
     guidance. The needle was exchanged for a 10 Fr dilator followed by a 12 Fr
     pigtail catheter which was placed under fluoroscopic guidance. The pigtail was
     formed and contrast was injected through the tube to confirm placement in the
     stomach. The tube was secured in place with a suture at the entry site and a
     cutaneous FlexiTrack.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 0.5 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of Fentanyl were administered by a
     Radiology nurse under continuous monitoring. Additionally, 1 mg of Glucagon
     was also administered.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: 12 Fr nephrostomy tube placed in the stomach for gastric suction.

     exchange PICC line placed by IV Therapy.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 430**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**], Attending Radiologist
     was present and supervised the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Informed signed consent was obtained from the patient through a
     Portuguese interpreter.  The right upper extremity was prepped in standard
     sterile fashion.  A .018 glide wire was passed through the existing PICC line
     and advanced into the SVC.  Then the PICC line was exchanged over the wire for
     a 4 French introducer sheath.  Following this, the glide wire was removed and
     a .018 guide wire with markings was advanced under fluoroscopy into the SVC.
     Based on the markers on the guide wire it was determined that a length of 46
     cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to this length and advanced
     over a 5 French introducer sheath under fluorscopic guidance into the SVC. The
     sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed.
     
     FINDINGS:  A final chest x-ray demonstrates a PICC line entering from the
     right with the tip in the distal SVC.  Additionally, an NG is noted on the
     radiograph.
     
     The line is ready for use.  There is good blood flow through both reports. A
     Stat-lock was applied and the lines was hep-locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange of a 46 cm total length 5 French double-lumen
     PICC line with the tip in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.
