HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
male patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who was referred for
outpatient cardiac catheterization after undergoing a
positive stress test.  He has a history of carotid artery
disease, and a stress test in [**3141-2-2**] revealed a
small mild anterior reversible defect.  The patient states he
has had chronic stable angina over the past several years
with angina occurring once every several days with exertion,
which was also responsive to sublingual nitroglycerin.

Recently, however, he has had two prolonged episodes that
occurred at rest and did not easily respond to nitroglycerin.
One episode lasted several hours and he subsequently saw his
primary care physician and his cardiologist, where he had a
stress test done on [**3144-8-7**], which was significant for chest
pain, ST depression in the V2 and V3 leads, leads 1 and aVL.
He did have dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath
associated with his angina.  He denies any claudication,
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lightheadedness, or
lower extremity edema.

His coronary artery disease risk factors include hypertension
and previous tobacco history.  He is nondiabetic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for spinal stenosis,
coronary artery disease, neuropathy of his feet, and severe
arm pain and tingling, which is treated with prednisone.  He
has no history of any transient ischemic attacks,
cerebrovascular accidents, or gastrointestinal bleeds.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a left carotid
endarterectomy in [**3141**] and two prior back surgeries.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Aspirin, Toprol 50 mg p.o. once daily,
prednisone 5 mg p.o. once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg
p.o. once daily, Imdur 30 mg p.o. once daily, M.V.I.,
Darvocet, Ritalin p.r.n., amitriptyline 75 mg p.o. q.h.s.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**3144-8-17**], which revealed an ejection
fraction of approximately 55%, 50% discrete right coronary
artery proximal stenosis, 95% mid RCA, 80% discrete stenosis
of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, 70%
of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery, 70%
diagonal 1 stenosis, 80% midcircumflex, and 70% distal
circumflex.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] for
coronary artery revascularization.

The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5 on
[**3144-8-21**].  The patient received a left internal mammary
artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal #1, and a
sequential graft to the obtuse marginal #2, saphenous vein
graft to the diagonal #1, and saphenous vein graft to the
right posterior descending coronary artery.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well without any complications, and
was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable
condition.

The patient was kept intubated overnight and was successfully
extubated the following day on postoperative day one.  He was
subsequently transferred to the floor later that day on
postoperative day one in stable condition.

On postoperative day two he remained afebrile with stable
vital signs in a regular rhythm.  D[**MD Number 850**] the evening of
postoperative day two the patient was noted to go into atrial
fibrillation.  He was treated with Lopressor intravenous
push.  Amiodarone drip was started and the patient was noted
still to be tachycardic with little response to the
amiodarone.  A diltiazem drip was also started, as the
patient did have V wires in place.  The patient's blood
pressure remained stable during the entire episode.

On the night of postoperative day two the patient was noted
to be in some respiratory distress.  An electrocardiogram was
obtained, which did not show any acute changes.  The patient
was noted to have coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  A chest
x-ray was obtained, which revealed fluid overload.  Thus, 80
mg of intravenous Lasix was given with a good response of the
patient, both with urine output and symptomatically with
increasing oxygen saturation.  Thus, he was maintained on
intravenous Lasix during the rest of his hospital course, and
subsequently his oxygen saturation and breathing pattern
improved dramatically.

On postoperative day three the patient was noted to convert
to a normal sinus rhythm.  His diltiazem drip was
discontinued.  His amiodarone drip was changed to p.o.
dosing.

Currently the patient is postoperative day four.  He is doing
extremely well.  He remains afebrile with stable vital signs
and normal sinus rhythm.  His current Lopressor dose is now
at 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He is currently maintained on
intravenous Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. and is diuresing well with
decreasing oxygen requirement and improving oxygen
saturation.

Physical therapy was consulted.  The patient was noted to
require much assistance with ambulation.  Thus, it is
believed that a short rehabilitation stay will be of much
benefit to the patient in order to return to his preoperative
ambulatory status.

As he is currently awaiting rehabilitation placement, the
patient will be discharged to rehabilitation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
grafting x 5.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Lasix 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. x seven days and then once daily.
3. K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days then once daily.
4. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
5. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. once daily.
6. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. once daily.
7. Dilaudid 2-4 mg p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
8. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. x 3 days, then 400 mg p.o.
b.i.d. x 7 days, then 400 mg p.o. once daily x 7 days, then
200 mg p.o. once daily.
9. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Albuterol nebulizers q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The patient should be ambulating with assistance until
able to ambulate at his preoperative status.
2. Aggressive chest physical therapy should be given.
3. The patient should be maintained on a cardiac diet.
4. He should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] in approximately three
weeks.

NKDA
MEDS: (per chart) ASA, toprol, prednisone, HCTZ, imdur, MVI, darvocet, ritalin, amitriphyline, rocaltrol

Pt went to the OR today [**8-21**], s/p CABG x 5 LIMA->LAD, SVG->om1->om2, SVG->D1, SVG->RPDA.

CV: T 36.8-38. Pt initially AP at 80, some changes made to pacer, but now in NSR 80's with no ectopy noted.  BP has been stable, some creeping up with vol, started on some Niride (.25), more for afteload reduction. Filling pressures were low, as well as CO/CI. Received 2 L Crystaloid, as well as 2 u prbc, and 500 hespan. CI inproved to 2.0, but mixed venous sat remains low 48%. Urine output ~30-50/hr. 

RESP: Fi02 weaned to 50% with good oxygenation. IMV 8, breathing 12 over, with TV 800. Most recent ABG: 90/38/7.46/2. Breath sounds clear to course requiring suctioning for thick white sputum. A lot of oral secretions noted. Chest tubes draining small amts sang. fluid, decreasing over shift.

GI: Oral gastric tube draining small amts bilious material. Receiving carafate.

SKIN: Back and sacrum intact. Large hematoma noted on rt groin area. No change. Feet and hands cool, feet with weakly palp. but audible doppler pulses. 

LABS: K 4.9. HCT 30 post tx 2 units. Ca 1.09 (given add'l 2 amps cal. glu). Lactic acid 1.8. Bl 237 (treated with 6 u reg). 

NEURO: Sedated on 30 propofol for most of evening. Recently decreased to 15. Pt breathing above vent, and moving head and upper extremities. Very slight mov't of lower extremities. Will not follow any commands as of yet, but appeared to nod when called his name. Would not open eyes to voice, but flickers eyes and moves tongue when name called. 

A/P: Pt has generally been stable; CO/CI did improve with vol. but low MV02 remains a puzzle in light of how well he looks overall.  Continue asssessment, and allow to lighten from propofol and assess response. Monitor labs.

Neuro: Pt is sedated on propofol.  Dose increased to 60mcg/kg/min from 50 b/c when Pt was light rr was up to 30s, Pt was coughing on ETT and BP was also elevated.  Increased ectopy also noted. Pt did not settle w/ sxning or morphine boluses. Pt squeezed w/ hands, opened eyes to voice, and moved legs to command when light. Of note Propofol leaking from Iv  insertion site this morning. ? how long he was not getting full dose. New IV placed and Pt is calm on vent. Hemodynamics back to baseline.

Resp:  Fio2 decreased to 50% from 60%.  Current vent settings: FiO2 50%, 5PEEP, 10 PS ans 700X12.  Pt presently taking 2-4 breaths over the vent.  ABG=81/38/7.46 and 28/+2.  Sa02=95-97%.  Sxning thick white, sometimes clear secretions.

CV: As noted above when Pt was "" light"" BP remained elevated, w to SBP in the 180s, despite morphine boluses or sxning.  NTG drip started to  maintain BP around 140/7O.  Pt was also having increased ectopy and briefly went into a rapid rhythm  ? afib/ SVT.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4721**] gave 2.5 IV lopressor.  HR returned to NSR. Calcium, magnesium and potassium are being repleted.  Cont. on amiodarone drip.  Also NTG has been titrated off.  Please see flowsheet for further data and assessment.   DP/PT pulses dopplerable bilaterally.

GI:  Abdomen is soft.  (+) bowel sounds.  (+) flatus.  Replete w/ fiber increased to 30cc/hr after residual checked.  

GU:  Foley to gravity.  UO=465cc MN-7am.  BUN/Cr=21/1.2.

Heme:  HCT=28.3 from 36.0.  No gross bleeding obsserved.  Discussed HCT w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4721**].  Plan to check again later today. 

ID:  Tmax=100.9 orally.  WBC=17.1 from 16.3.  Continues on triple antibiotics.  Cultures pending.

Skin:  Chest dressing dry and inatct.  Right leg incision w/ steristrips intact.  No drainage.  Skin on backside intact.

A: Tolerated decrease in Fio2.  Hypertensive when less sedated.  ? etiology of rapid HR: Increased ectopy b/c less sedated or b/c electrolytes needed repletion? Tolerating slow increase in tubefeedings.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      66 year old man s/p cabg, re-intubated for resp distress. now with persistant
      resp failure/vent dep. and persistant fevers of unclear etiology.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for abscess, intra-abd process
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Persistent fevers unknown etiology.  Rule out intraabdominal
     process.  The patient is status post CABG.
     
     Sternal wires and clips overlie within the cardia consistent with patient's
     history.  There is vascular calcification of the aorta.  There is a small
     pericardial effusion.  The trachea and esophagus are unremarkable.  No
     significant lymphadenopathy is visualized.  There is increased attenuation
     within the mediastinal fat consistent with the patient's history recent
     thoracotomy. On evaluation of the soft tissue within the sternum there is a
     soft tissue lesion seen series 4, image 28 that measured 3 x 3.8 cm which may
     represent a sternal collection.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  There
     is increased opacity involving both lung fields with sparing of the periphery
     of the lungs suggesting ARDS although an infectious process cannot be entirely
     excluded. Less likely to represent pulmonary edema.  There is bibasilar
     atelectasis more significant within the left base.  There is no pneumothorax
     or pleural effusion.  Again in the absence of pleural effusion CHF is less
     likely.
     
     ABDOMEN:  The liver is normal attenuation. There are no masses.  The
     gallbladder, spleen and adrenal glands are normal.  There is atrophy of the
     pancreas with no evidence of inflammation.  The kidneys are normal.  No
     hydronephrosis.  The small and large bowel are normal. No fluid collections
     are seen.
     
     BLADDER:  There is vascular calcification consistent with atherosclerotic
     disease.  The bladder is grossly unremarkable, although this is undistended.
     There is no free fluid within the cul-de-sac.  The osseous structures and soft
     tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Small pericardial effusion with post operative changes within the
     mediastinum.
     
     There is a soft tissue mass between the sternotomy which may represent a fluid
     collection and clinical correlation is recommended.
     
     Bilateral parenchymal opacity suggestive of ARDS although infection is less
     likely cannot be entirely excluded.
     
     Left bibasilar atelectasis left greater than right.
     
     Normal examination of the abdomen and pelvis.
                                                                 (Over)
