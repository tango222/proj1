     CT RECONSTRUCTION
     Reason: please evaluate for renal mass

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old woman with severe hematuria and concern for invading mass in
      urinary system.  s/p CVAs, nursing home resident.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please evaluate for renal mass

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST FROM [**3029-7-24**] AT 17:50.
     
     INDICATION:  Hematuria through Foley catheter in a pseudodemented patient who
     is a nursing home resident.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images were obtained from the lung bases through the
     pubic symphysis without the use of oral or IV contrast (patient has an
     elevated creatinine).
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a small left pleural effusion and
     basilar atelectasis bilaterally. There are pleural calcifications at the lung
     bases.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. Scattered calcifications are seen
     throughout a fatty liver.  The gallbladder is poorly visualized but has a
     normal appearance.  The pancreas and spleen appear grossly normal.
     
     There are multiple vascular calcifications along the aorta, renal arteries,
     SMA, splenic arteries, and iliac vessels.
     
     Multiple punctate calcifications are seen within the kidneys.  The kidneys are
     grossly normal on this non-contrast examination.  There are no exophytic
     lobulations or areas of hypodensity.  There is no hydronephrosis or
     perinephric stranding.  The ureters are non-dilated throughout their course.
     The bladder contains a Foley and is partially collapsed.  There is some high-
     density material within the bladder which could represent soft tissue or clot.
      In the absence of IV contrast it is difficult to differentiate.
     
     There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.  The large and small
     bowel are non-opacified but adequately visualized.  There are no areas of wall
     thickening or luminal dilatation or focal adjacent mesenteric stranding.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Within the mid pelvis is a 4 x 3 cm ovoid
     lesion containing frank fat in a mural nodular soft-tissue density.  This
     structure is adjacent to the expected location of the uterus and likely
     represents a dermoid cyst.  Multiple diverticula are seen along the course of
     the colon but there is no evidence of diverticulitis.  There are no enlarged
     pelvic, mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  There are scattered non-
     enlarged inguinal lymph nodes.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) On this non-contrast CT examination there is no evidence of renal mass.
     High-density material within the bladder is likely blood clot but a small
     bladder wall mass cannot be excluded in this non-distended bladder in the
     absence of IV contrast.  An ultrasound examination of the kidneys and bladder
     with the Foley catheter clamped would be a useful study for better
     visualization of these structures.
     
     2) Dermoid within the pelvis.
     
     These results were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1806**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
