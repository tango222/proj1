Admission Date:  [**2652-3-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2652-3-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2570-3-17**]     Sex:  F

Service:  C-MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82 year old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft who presented with on and off
chest pain radiating to the back times two weeks.  She had
been getting relief with sublingual Nitroglycerin up to the
date of admission.  The chest pain lasted for five minutes at
rest or with activity.  The patient denied any nausea,
vomiting,diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  Chest pain is
not similar to her prior chest pain when she had coronary
artery bypass graft.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was hypertensive to
210/100.  CK and troponin were both flat.  The patient
received Aspirin, Lopressor 5 mg intravenously times two and
Heparin and became chest pain free.  Electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm with new 1.0 to 2.0 millimeter ST segment
elevation in V1 and V2, T wave inversion in leads I and aVL
and there is a question of 1.[**Street Address 1442**] depression in
leads II, III and aVF.  Chest x-ray was done and shows no
cardiopulmonary process.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2639**], after failed left anterior descending
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with
dissection.
2.  Renal carcinoma, status post partial nephrectomy in [**2646**].
3.  Colon polyp.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Diabetes mellitus.
6.  Mitral regurgitation 2+ in [**2651-6-1**], on echocardiogram.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking fourteen years ago
and no use of alcohol.  The patient lives alone.  Rarely
needs to [**Known patient lastname **] with a cane.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient is afebrile,
heart rate 75, blood pressure 140/80, respiratory rate 20,
oxygen saturation 97% in room air.  The patient is a pleasant
elderly lady lying in bed, breathing comfortably, in no
apparent distress.  Sclera anicteric.  Mucous membranes are
moist.  The oropharynx is clear.  The neck is supple with no
lymphadenopathy.  No jugular venous distention.  No
thyromegaly.  The lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The heart is regular rate and rhythm, S1 and
S2, no murmurs.  The belly is soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities have no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  The patient is alert and
oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  The
patient has full muscle strength throughout the upper and
lower extremities.  Sensory is intact to light touch.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Labile blood pressure - On the day of admission, the
patient was placed on Nitroglycerin drip and her blood
pressure consistently elevated and only slightly dropped to
180s.  The patient was also given Hydralazine every four
hours as needed. On the night of admission, the patient had
episode of hypotension.  Her blood pressure dropped down to
70s and Nitroglycerin drip was discontinued.  The patient was
placed on Lopressor.  The patient's blood pressure remained
stable on the day after admission, however, by noon, the
patient's blood pressure was elevated again and we had to
restart Nitroglycerin drip on her and also increase her
Lopressor dose.  The patient's blood pressure plummeted again
to 70s and she became hypoxic. The patient was placed on
nonrebreather oxygen and the patient's oxygen saturation only
returned to 80s.  Arterial blood gas was drawn showing pH of
7.21, CO2 of 60 and O2 of 90.  The patient was transferred to
the CCU.  While in the CCU, the patient received 80 mg
intravenous Lasix and Nitroglycerin drip and also had a head
CT for having some change in mental status and delirium.  CT
was negative and Heparin was stopped.  The patient was
intubated for hypercarbia and hypoxia on [**2652-3-27**].  The
patient was also treated with Dopamine for hypotension
episode while on Nitroglycerin drip.  The patient had another
episode of hypotension and was briefly treated with
intravenous Nitride.  The patient was extubated on [**2652-3-28**],
and was started on beta blocker and ace inhibitor.  The
patient was also started on Levofloxacin for question of
pneumonia in the right middle lobe and also she spiked fever
to 101.8.  The patient had good response to intravenous Lasix
on [**2652-3-28**], and was transferred back to the floor on
[**2652-3-29**], after her blood pressure became more stable.  The
patient was continued on both beta blocker and ace inhibitor
and her blood pressure remained stable until the time of
discharge.

2.  Coronary artery disease - Most likely she had
subendocardial ischemia with possible saphenous vein
graft/posterior descending artery region.  The patient had
stress MIBI done that showed there is a severe fixed apical
perfusion defect unchanged from prior study.  Ejection
fraction was 37%.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by enzymes.  We continued the patient on Aspirin,
beta blocker, Univasc and increased the Lipitor to 40 mg once
daily.

3.  Chest pain - Originally, the patient reported chest pain
radiating to the back.  Original concern was for dissection
but the patient had negative CTA done and also a negative
transesophageal echocardiogram.  Her chest pain is most
likely consistent with ischemia in the setting of severe
hypertension.  With resolution of her hypertension, the
patient remained chest pain free throughout the rest of her
hospital stay.

4.  Diabetes mellitus - The patient's blood sugar remained
stable throughout her hospital stay.  We held Metformin given
that she had CTA and we continued her with Glyburide and
covered her with regular insulin sliding scale.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA services.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable, taking p.o., afebrile, blood
pressure well controlled.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypotension.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levothyroxine 25 mcg take 0.5 tablet p.o. once daily.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Glyburide 10 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Univasc 15 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. twice a day.
