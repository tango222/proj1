Service:  TRAUMA [**Last Name (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 78-year-old male, unrestrained
passenger in a motor vehicle crash, questionable loss of
consciousness, complaining of neck pain at an outside
hospital where he was found to have a displaced C-spine
fracture.  He also was reported to have a V-tach arrest,
which responded to two shocks and lidocaine at the outside
hospital.  On arrival, he was intubated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CHF, ejection fraction 20%, coronary
artery disease, hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Left carotid endarterectomy two years
ago, left hernia repair.

8.  KCl 20 mEq q.day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate between 80 and 20, blood
pressure 160/80, saturations 100%, respiratory rate - on the
vent.  GENERAL:  Intubated.  GCS:  11-T.  Opens eyes, follows
commands, moves all extremities to command.  Superficial
abrasion on forehead.  PERRLA, 2 - 3 mm.  Trachea midline.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Bowel sounds present,
nontender, flat.  Pelvis stable.  Extremities warm, no
deformities.  Palpable DP pulses bilaterally.

INITIAL LABS:  14.7, 34.6, 16.8.  Chem-7:  136, 4.4, 104, 19,
25, 1.2, 147.  ABGs:  7.29, 45, 167, 23, and -4.  Coags:
12.9, 28, 1.2.  Fibrinogen 381.

INITIAL RADIOLOGY:  The patient has a chest x-ray which
showed opacities at bilateral upper lobes, consistent with
contusion.

CT of chest confirms pulmonary contusion.

Pelvis exam negative.

CT of the chest otherwise unremarkable except for findings
noted above.  CT of abdomen and CT of pelvis negative.  CT of
the head showed no intracranial hemorrhage.  CT of the
C-spine showed a C3-C4 fracture with extensive soft tissue
swelling, fusion secondary to ankylosing spondylosis.  No
cord abnormality.  CT of the T-spine was done on [**3438-10-23**]
which showed ankylosis but no fractures on the CT of T-spine
and CT of L-spine.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Surgical ICU.  In the Surgical ICU for the V-tach arrest the
patient was placed on lidocaine drip.  Swan-Ganz was placed.
The patient had an angiogram to evaluate carotids, vertebral
arteries, which was negative for injury.  A-line was placed.
Orthopaedic spine was consulted, recommended steroid course
for the patient.  The patient was subsequently placed on
methylprednisolone.  The patient went to the O.R. on
[**3438-10-22**] for a C3 to C4 vertebrectomy with open reduction
of C3 to C4 fracture dislocation, and C3 to C4 fusion with an
allograft.

In the Surgical ICU, the patient had repeat episodes of
decreased blood pressure and was given multiple fluid
boluses.  The patient's hematocrit decreased to 28.  The
patient was given two units of packed red blood cells on
[**3438-10-25**].  On [**3438-10-25**], the patient returned to the
operating room for a C2 to C6 posterolateral fusion with
instrumentation with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 584**].  He was transfused four units
of red blood cells, no complications.

On [**3438-10-27**], the patient was weaned and extubated.  On
[**3438-10-28**], the patient had an episode of decreased O2 sat,
cyanosis, unresponsive, patient in asystole with a pulse, not
responding to commands.  The patient was reintubated, given
1 amp of atropine, 1 amp of epi.  CPR continued.  Sternal
pacing was initiated.  Baseline rhythm was present after
code.  Left radial A-line was placed [**3438-10-28**].  After code
episode, the patient developed weakness in the left upper
extremity.  Head CT was performed which showed no infarct and
no bleed, no changes from previous CT.  TPN was started.

ENT was consulted for patient after three episodes of failed
extubation.  ENT evaluated this patient for copious
secretions, possible upper airway obstruction.  Bronch
showing minimal secretions.  Laryngeal exam showed minimal to
moderate edema, which would be expected in an intubated
patient.  The patient was placed on Zosyn for UTI and sputum
culture positive for Pseudomonas.

The patient was weaned  off TPN on [**3438-10-27**], changed to
tube-feeds.  The patient failed extubation a total of three
times in the unit and was reintubated.  Trach was placed on
[**3438-11-6**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient had Passe Muir speaking
valve trial, which was successful.  The patient had a swallow
evaluation on [**3438-11-15**], which patient failed.  The patient
had non-functional pharyngeal swallow reflex, thought
secondary to cervical hardware and soft tissue swelling,
which significantly limited the patient's swallowing ability.
Recommended PEG tube.  The patient is currently scheduled
for a PEG placement on [**3438-11-16**].

The patient subsequently stepped down to the floor on
[**3438-11-8**].  Right subclavian line was changed on [**3438-11-7**].
The patient was noted to have guaiac-positive stool on
[**3438-11-12**].  Hematocrit was checked, hematocrit decreased from
31.1 to 21.  The patient was given two units of packed red
blood cells, placed on Sucralfate, and proton pump
inhibitors.  Hematocrit remained stable.  Did not do upper
endoscopy secondary to hardware in posterior neck.  NG lavage
was done, negative for blood.  Will refer patient for
outpatient workup for lower GI bleeding source colonoscopy.
Will hold on GI consult as hematocrit is currently stable.

While in hospital, the patient was also evaluated by
Cardiology on [**3438-11-8**] for questionable V-tach arrest.
Cardiology electrophysiology attending evaluated, reported
V-tach arrest on arrival, questioned if true given baseline
left bundle branch block.  He is a candidate for coronary
evaluation once improved, not recommended during this
admission unless clinical situation changes.  Recommend
increasing Atenolol to 25 mg p.o. q.day, DC digoxin and
aspirin q.d. once hematocrit is stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  68 year old man status post motor vehicle accident with
     known cervical spine fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis following the administration of 150
     cc of Optiray contrast IV per the trauma protocol.  In addition, sagittal
     reconstructions through the chest were performed.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an endotracheal tube within the superior
     trachea.  The aorta appears intact and there is no evidence of mediastinal
     hematoma.  The pulmonary arteries are also normal in appearance.  No
     extravasation of contrast is seen.  The heart is unremarkable with the
     exception of coronary artery calcifications and no pericardial effusion is
     seen.  There are no pleural effusions.  Lung windows demonstrate diffuse
     ground glass opacities at the lung apices as well as in the left upper and
     lower lobes.  No focal consolidation is identified.  There is dependent
     atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands,
     pancreas and spleen are all within normal limits.  The kidneys demonstrate
     prompt symmetric excretion of contrast.  No parenchymal disruptions are seen
     in any of the solid organs of the abdomen.  There is atherosclerotic disease
     of the aorta but the aortic caliber is normal.  The visualized loops of large
     and small bowel in the abdomen are within normal limits.  There is no free air
     or free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter and air within
     the urinary bladder.  The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable and there
     is no free fluid in the pelvis.  There is a left-sided hydrocele.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  68 year old man status post motor vehicle crash with
     known cervical spine fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the foramen magnum
     through the cranial vertex without the administration of IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Several images are degraded by patient motion
     artifact.  Allowing for this limitation, there is no definite evidence for
     acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no mass effect or shift of
     normally midline structures.  Where visualized, the [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-white matter
     differentiation appears intact.
     
     There is soft tissue density within the sinuses with diffuse sclerosis of the
     right maxillary sinus.  The presence of the soft tissue is not unexpected
     given the presence of the endotracheal tube.  No acute skull fractures are
     identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Allowing for limitations of motion artifact, no acute
     intracranial hemorrhage or edema identified.

     INDICATION:  C3-4 distraction injury, evaluate cord.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images were obtained without
     contrast.  Additional IR sagittal images were also obtained.
     
     Comparison with prior CT from [**3438-10-22**].
     
     MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Again seen is a fracture in the
     anterior aspect of C3 extending in the C3-4 intervertebral space and causing a
     severe kyphotic deformity due to severe angulation at the fracture site. There
     is narrowing of the canal at C3-4 accentuated by infolding of the posterior
     ligaments at this level.  There is no evidence of cord signal abnormality.
     There is extensive soft tissue swelling in the anterior prevertebral soft
     tissues.  Again seen is fusion of the vertebra suggesting ankylosing
     spondylitis.  There is a widened upper thoracic right foramina probably
     related to a large diverticulum or a neurofibroma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Severe kyphotic deformity secondary to distraction injury at C3-4
     causing narrowing of the spinal canal at this level, but without abnormal cord
     signal abnormality.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  68 year old man status post motor vehicle accident with
     known cervical spine fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis following the administration of 150
     cc of Optiray contrast IV per the trauma protocol.  In addition, sagittal
     reconstructions through the chest were performed.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an endotracheal tube within the superior
     trachea.  The aorta appears intact and there is no evidence of mediastinal
     hematoma.  The pulmonary arteries are also normal in appearance.  No
     extravasation of contrast is seen.  The heart is unremarkable with the
     exception of coronary artery calcifications and no pericardial effusion is
     seen.  There are no pleural effusions.  Lung windows demonstrate diffuse
     ground glass opacities at the lung apices as well as in the left upper and
     lower lobes.  No focal consolidation is identified.  There is dependent
     atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands,
     pancreas and spleen are all within normal limits.  The kidneys demonstrate
     prompt symmetric excretion of contrast.  No parenchymal disruptions are seen
     in any of the solid organs of the abdomen.  There is atherosclerotic disease
     of the aorta but the aortic caliber is normal.  The visualized loops of large
     and small bowel in the abdomen are within normal limits.  There is no free air
     or free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter and air within
     the urinary bladder.  The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable and there
     is no free fluid in the pelvis.  There is a left-sided hydrocele.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes and diffuse demineralization.
     There are exuberant anterior osteophytes noted.  No acute fractures are
     identified.

     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  78 year old man status post trauma with known cervical
     spine fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     base of the skull through the lung apices without the administration of IV
     contrast.  In addition, coronal and sagittal reconstructions were performed.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     CERVICAL SPINE CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The vertebral column is completely
     disrupted with a fracture through the vertebral body of C3.  There is fusion
     of the vertebral bodies secondary to thick ossification of the anterior
     longitudinal ligament raising the question of ankylosing spondylitis.
     Therefore, C2 and C3 act as a single component separate from the lower
     cervical spine of C4 through C7. The superior portion of the vertebral column
     is angulated posteriorly and is posteriorly positioned with respect to the
     inferior portion of the vertebral column.  Despite this severe disruption of
     the osseous column, the central canal is rather well preserved with the most
     significant narrowing noted at the level of the fracture of C3.  The central
     canal still measures approximately 1 cm in diameter at this level and there is
     no significant compromise of the canal by fracture fragments.  Fracture does
     involve the foramen transversarium on the right at the C3 level, raising
     concern for possible injury of the right vertebral artery.  Given the
     significant degree of disruption of the vertebral column, disruption of the
     left vertebral artery also cannot be excluded.  The prevertebral soft tissues
     contain subcutaneous emphysema.  There is an endotracheal tube within the
     trachea.  Ground glass opacities of the lung apices are present consistent
     with pulmonary contusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Complete disruption of the vertebral column at the C3-4 level
     with fracture through the C3 vertebral body and posterior angulation of the
     superior portion of the vertebral column.  As described above, calcification
     of the anterior longitudinal ligament results in the vertebral column acting
     as a single unit rather than separate vertebral bodies.  However, the central
     canal appears rather well preserved.  Vascular injury involving the vertebral
     arteries should be considered in light of the significant osseous disruption.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Cervical fracture, motor vehicle accident.  Rule-out
     carotid vertebral dissection.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of traumatic dissection of the carotid
     vertebral artery.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia and local infiltration of the
     right groin using Lidocaine.
     
     INDICATION:  This patient is a 78-year-old man who was involved in a motor
     vehicle accident and was noted to have a cervical fracture. He underwent
     cerebral angiogram in order to rule-out possibility of carotid vertebral
     artery dissection.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's family was given and full and complete explanation of
     the procedure including the risks, benefits, and possible complications. They
     understood and wished to proceed.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a 4 French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the right common femoral artery. A 4 French Berenstein Type
     2 catheter was used to selectively catheterize the following vessels in
     selective fashion in a sequential fashion as follows: Right common carotid
     artery, right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, left subclavian
     artery, left common carotid artery.  With the catheter in each of these
     positions, a series  of angiographic runs were performed in single plane and
     biplane projections of the neck and head.  The catheter was then withdrawn
     from the patient, the vascular sheath was removed, and manual compression was
     used to achieve hemostasis.  The patient was transferred back to the Trauma
     Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals diffuse
     atherosclerotic disease throughout the high cervical segment of the right
     internal carotid artery.  There is an approximately 40% stenosis at the origin
     of the right internal carotid artery.  In addition, there is an approximately
     focal 50%  stenosis in the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery and
     the anterior segment of the anterior cerebral artery appears to be
                                                                 (Over)

     hypoplastic.  There are no intracranial branch occlusions and no evidence of
     traumatic dissection.  Injection of the right subclavian artery reveals no
     evidence of injury  in the subclavian artery and the origin of the vertebral
     artery is free of stenosis.  Injection of the right vertebral artery, which
     appears to be hypoplastic, shows a small focal area of extrinsic compression
     resulting in a small 50% stenosis in the mid segment of the right vertebral
     artery which is not hemodynamically significant.  Injection of the left
     subclavian artery reveals diffuse atherosclerotic change resulting in 50%
     stenosis in the subclavian artery, mid clavicular segment.  The left vertebral
     artery is diminutive and shows low flow as a result of chronic low flow
     demand.  Injection of left common carotid artery reveals a pedulous
     bifurcation with a small focal region of approximately 30% stenosis at the
     origin of the left internal carotid artery. The left internal carotid artery
     is found to supply both anterior cerebral arteries via a dominant A1 segment.
     The right and left external carotid arteries failed to reveal any evidence of

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Cervical fracture, motor vehicle accident.  Rule-out
     carotid vertebral dissection.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of traumatic dissection of the carotid
     vertebral artery.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia and local infiltration of the
     right groin using Lidocaine.
     
     INDICATION:  This patient is a 78-year-old man who was involved in a motor
     vehicle accident and was noted to have a cervical fracture. He underwent
     cerebral angiogram in order to rule-out possibility of carotid vertebral
     artery dissection.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's family was given and full and complete explanation of
     the procedure including the risks, benefits, and possible complications. They
     understood and wished to proceed.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a 4 French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the right common femoral artery. A 4 French Berenstein Type
     2 catheter was used to selectively catheterize the following vessels in
     selective fashion in a sequential fashion as follows: Right common carotid
     artery, right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, left subclavian
     artery, left common carotid artery.  With the catheter in each of these
     positions, a series  of angiographic runs were performed in single plane and
     biplane projections of the neck and head.  The catheter was then withdrawn
     from the patient, the vascular sheath was removed, and manual compression was
     used to achieve hemostasis.  The patient was transferred back to the Trauma
     Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals diffuse
     atherosclerotic disease throughout the high cervical segment of the right
     internal carotid artery.  There is an approximately 40% stenosis at the origin
     of the right internal carotid artery.  In addition, there is an approximately
     focal 50%  stenosis in the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery and
     the anterior segment of the anterior cerebral artery appears to be

     artery is free of stenosis.  Injection of the right vertebral artery, which
     appears to be hypoplastic, shows a small focal area of extrinsic compression
     resulting in a small 50% stenosis in the mid segment of the right vertebral
     artery which is not hemodynamically significant.  Injection of the left
     subclavian artery reveals diffuse atherosclerotic change resulting in 50%
     stenosis in the subclavian artery, mid clavicular segment.  The left vertebral
     artery is diminutive and shows low flow as a result of chronic low flow
     demand.  Injection of left common carotid artery reveals a pedulous
     bifurcation with a small focal region of approximately 30% stenosis at the
     origin of the left internal carotid artery. The left internal carotid artery
     is found to supply both anterior cerebral arteries via a dominant A1 segment.

     evidence of injury  in the subclavian artery and the origin of the vertebral
     artery is free of stenosis.  Injection of the right vertebral artery, which
     appears to be hypoplastic, shows a small focal area of extrinsic compression
     resulting in a small 50% stenosis in the mid segment of the right vertebral
     artery which is not hemodynamically significant.  Injection of the left
     subclavian artery reveals diffuse atherosclerotic change resulting in 50%
     stenosis in the subclavian artery, mid clavicular segment.  The left vertebral
     artery is diminutive and shows low flow as a result of chronic low flow
     demand.  Injection of left common carotid artery reveals a pedulous
     bifurcation with a small focal region of approximately 30% stenosis at the
     origin of the left internal carotid artery. The left internal carotid artery
     is found to supply both anterior cerebral arteries via a dominant A1 segment.
     The right and left external carotid arteries failed to reveal any evidence of

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Cervical fracture, motor vehicle accident.  Rule-out
     carotid vertebral dissection.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of traumatic dissection of the carotid
     vertebral artery.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia and local infiltration of the
     right groin using Lidocaine.
     
     INDICATION:  This patient is a 78-year-old man who was involved in a motor
     vehicle accident and was noted to have a cervical fracture. He underwent
     cerebral angiogram in order to rule-out possibility of carotid vertebral
     artery dissection.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's family was given and full and complete explanation of
     the procedure including the risks, benefits, and possible complications. They
     understood and wished to proceed.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a 4 French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the right common femoral artery. A 4 French Berenstein Type
     2 catheter was used to selectively catheterize the following vessels in
     selective fashion in a sequential fashion as follows: Right common carotid
     artery, right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, left subclavian
     artery, left common carotid artery.  With the catheter in each of these
     positions, a series  of angiographic runs were performed in single plane and
     biplane projections of the neck and head.  The catheter was then withdrawn
     from the patient, the vascular sheath was removed, and manual compression was
     used to achieve hemostasis.  The patient was transferred back to the Trauma
     Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals diffuse
     atherosclerotic disease throughout the high cervical segment of the right
     internal carotid artery.  There is an approximately 40% stenosis at the origin
     of the right internal carotid artery.  In addition, there is an approximately
     focal 50%  stenosis in the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery and
     the anterior segment of the anterior cerebral artery appears to be

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Cervical fracture, motor vehicle accident.  Rule-out
     carotid vertebral dissection.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of traumatic dissection of the carotid
     vertebral artery.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia and local infiltration of the
     right groin using Lidocaine.
     
     INDICATION:  This patient is a 78-year-old man who was involved in a motor
     vehicle accident and was noted to have a cervical fracture. He underwent
     cerebral angiogram in order to rule-out possibility of carotid vertebral
     artery dissection.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's family was given and full and complete explanation of
     the procedure including the risks, benefits, and possible complications. They
     understood and wished to proceed.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a 4 French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the right common femoral artery. A 4 French Berenstein Type
     2 catheter was used to selectively catheterize the following vessels in
     selective fashion in a sequential fashion as follows: Right common carotid
     artery, right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, left subclavian
     artery, left common carotid artery.  With the catheter in each of these
     positions, a series  of angiographic runs were performed in single plane and
     biplane projections of the neck and head.  The catheter was then withdrawn
     from the patient, the vascular sheath was removed, and manual compression was
     used to achieve hemostasis.  The patient was transferred back to the Trauma
     Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals diffuse
     atherosclerotic disease throughout the high cervical segment of the right
     internal carotid artery.  There is an approximately 40% stenosis at the origin
     of the right internal carotid artery.  In addition, there is an approximately
     focal 50%  stenosis in the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery and
     the anterior segment of the anterior cerebral artery appears to be

SOCIAL WORK NOTE:
New trauma pt on T-SICU.  Pt is a 78 year old married man who is s/p MVC as an unrestrained passenger.  He sustained a neck fx and is expected to be in the OR all day today.  Pt's wife, [**Doctor First Name 1069**], was driving the car.  This SW phoned her today to offer support ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4405**]).  She is very hard of hearing.  She reports that the car in front of her stopped short.  She said that she and her husband do not wear their seatbelts.  Pt's wife sounded anxious about accident and reports that she has high blood pressure and diabetes.  This SW urged her to call her PCP to alert him of this stressful event in case it has an effect on her health.

Pt and his wife do not have any children.  They live in [**Location (un) 4406**].  Wife's sister, [**Doctor First Name 4407**] Panagopoulos, is also involved and their niece/godchild, [**Doctor First Name 1822**], has been main contact person.  Her number is in chart which is with pt in OR.  This SW will try to reach [**Doctor First Name 1822**] tomorrow to introduce self and offer support and assistance as needed.

     pharynx.  There is minimal laryngeal elevation and no epiglottic deflection.
     The pyriform sinuses are narrowed, possibly due to crowding from the above
     mentioned cervical spine angulation.  Aspiration is seen with thin and nectar
     thickened liquids.  There is inconsistent cough and clearing of the airway.
     Moderate amount of secretions are present as well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Aspiration and poor protection of the airway, likely due to a
     combination of anatomic and physiologic factors, including mid cervical spine
     anterior angulation and decreased pharyngeal motor control and initiation of
     swallow.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 78-year-old male status post motor vehicle accident.Failed swallow
     study.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 30 ml of Conray 60%.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained. The stomach was insufflated with air via the
     nasogastric tube. Two T-fasteners were then placed under fluoroscopic
     guidance, anchoring the anterior gastric wall to the abdominal wall. A 18
     gauge needle was then used to access the stomach followed by passage of an
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire. The tract was then dilated to 5 Fr, and a 5 Fr sheath
     placed. The [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire, with aid of a 5 Fr multipurpose catheter, was used
     to access the duodenum, and the wire and catheter were advanced into the
     proximal jejunum. The [**Last Name (un) 767**] wire was subsequently removed, and an 0.035
     straight Amplatz wire was placed. The catheter and sheath were subsequently
     removed, and the tract was dilated to 14 Fr, followed by placement of a 14 Fr
     peelaway sheath. A 14 Fr [**Doctor Last Name 1059**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was then lubricated
     in advance through the peelaway sheath, over the wire, and the sheath was
     subsequently removed. 10 cc of contrast material was then injected through the
     catheter, followed by flushing with 10 cc of normal saline. An xray was
     obtained following injection, documenting a jejunal position. The tip projects
     to the right of midline. The locking loop is formed in the second/third
     portion of the duodenum.  This exam was reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**].
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 14 Fr [**Doctor Last Name 1059**] gastrojejunostomy catheter
     with the tip in the jejunum. OK for use on [**3438-11-17**].
