History of Present Illness:
56 year old with alcoholic cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease 
who has been ""in and out"" of the [**Location 6322**] over 
the past few months for repeated episodes of LE cellulitis 
including ? nec fascitis on one occasion.  He had been in a 
rehab hospital today (was sent there from the VA) and was 
feeling well per his report, wanting to be D/C'd when they got 
labs that were concerning (hct, cr) and sent him to [**Hospital 5860**] Hospital.  There he was found to have a Hct of 27, SBP 
in the 60's, Melena.  He was started on levophed and NS ""wide 
open"" through one 20 Ga IV.  He was transferred here.  On 
arrival in the ED here, he was afebrile, HR 91, BP 72/36 RR 20

     catheter.
     
     Details of the procedure and possible complications were explained to the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4**] was performing the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique, local anesthesia and ultrasound guidance,
     an access was obtained at the right internal jugular vein.  A micropuncture
     set was used for access.  A micropuncture sheath was then placed over the
     wire.  A guide wire was placed through the sheath and introduced into the IVC
     under fluoroscopic guidance.  The tract was dilated with a 12 French dilator.
     
     A temporary triple lumen dialysis catheter was then placed over the wire with
     its tip positioned in the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance.  Position
     of the catheter was confirmed by chest x-ray in one view.  The guide wire was
     then removed.  The catheter was secured to the skin.  A sterile dressing was
     applied.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o portal venous thrombosis, assess ascitesPlease mark for paracentesis 
      (concern for loculations)
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  56-year-old male with cirrhosis and ascites, now with respiratory
     distress.  Evaluate for portal venous thrombosis, and ascites.
     
     ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  No prior studies are available for comparison.  The
     gallbladder is contracted and shrunken and is filled with echogenic stones and
     sludge.  There is a large amount of ascites surrounding the liver.  The liver
     is markedly shrunken and has a nodular surface contour consistent with known
     cirrhosis, but there is no evidence of any focal lesion or discrete textural
     abnormality. The common duct is not dilated.  There is no evidence of intra-
     or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The portal vein is patent with
     appropriate hepatopetal flow, but the portal vein is markedly enlarged which
     is indicative of a significant degree of portal hypertension.  The right
     kidney measures 13.0 cm, the left kidney measures 12.5 cm.  There is no
     evidence of stone, mass or hydronephrosis in either kidney.  There is evidence
     of splenomegaly, however, a measurement was not obtained on this study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Cirrhotic liver with large amount of ascites.
     2.  Contracted gallbladder filled with stones and sludge.
     3.  Patent portal vein with appropriate antegrade flow, however, the portal
     vein is enlarged which is indicative of significant portal hypertension.
     4.  Splenomegaly.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  End-stage liver and renal disease with deep duodenal bulb ulcer
     seen on EGD.  Status post paracentesis earlier today.  Evaluate for ulcer
     perforation.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal ultrasound of the same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral contrast only.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformatted images were generated.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small left pleural effusion with
     associated atelectasis.  The tip of a catheter is seen at the cavoatrial
     junction.  Assessment of the abdominal organs is limited without IV contrast.
     The liver is shrunken and nodular in contour, consistent with cirrhosis. There
     is high-density material in the region of the gallbladder, consistent with
     stones.  The spleen demonstrates a couple of hyperdense foci, of indeterminate
     etiology.  The spleen is enlarged in the craniocaudad dimension (coronal
     reformatted images) measuring 17.8 cm.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are
     unremarkable, as are the kidneys on this non-contrast enhanced study.  The
     stomach and duodenum contain oral contrast. Small bowel loops are mildly
     dilated, with a prominent bowel wall.  There appears to be fecal material in
     some mildly distended small bowel loops in the mid abdomen, measuring up to 3
     cm in diameter.  However, there is air and stool within the colon.  There is
     no free air in the abdomen.  There is a moderate to large amount of ascites
     fluid, greatest surrounding the liver.  The aorta is not dilated and contains
     calcifications.  The splenic vein is difficult to visualize though it appears
     large.  There also appear to be varices in the anterior abdominal wall and
     within the anterior abdomen near the umbilicus. Soft tissue density near the
     gastroesophageal junction raises the possibility of varices at this locale as
     well.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is air in the bladder related to
     instrumentation with a Foley catheter.  The rectum appears normal.  There are
     sigmoid diverticula present.  Moderate free fluid in the pelvis.  Moderate
     subcutaneous edema.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.  There
     are healed left posterior rib fractures at the left basilar chest.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No free air within the retroperitoneum or within the abdomen to suggest
     perforated duodenal ulcer.
     
     2.  Findings of cirrhosis, including a nodular shrunken liver, splenomegaly,
     ascites, abdominal and possible gastroesophageal varices.
     
     3.  Mildly distended small bowel loops, with prominent small bowel wall.  Some
     small bowel loops contain fecal material, likely related to ileus.  The colon
     contains air and stool, suggesting that there is not a mechanical obstruction.

     INDICATION:  Hypotension.  Evaluate for CHF or pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     SUPINE AP CHEST:
     
     The chest was imaged from a lordotic view.  The heart size is normal.  The
     mediastinal contours are probably normal given the technique. The right
     hemidiaphragm is elevated.  No consolidation or evidence of congestive
     failure.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are rounded calcified
     structures in the right upper quadrant, likely representing gallstones.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or congestive failure. Probable
     gallstones.

     HISTORY:  Hepatitis, hypotension.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-4**]:
     
     Severe elevation of the diaphragm due to intestinal distention and ascites
     produces severe compromise of lung volume, which has worsened since [**8-4**], a
     more severe bibasilar atelectasis, particularly on the left.  Heart size is
     exaggerated by the elevated diaphragm, probably normal.  Pulmonary vascular
     engorgement is probably a function of redistribution of perfusion away from
     the lung bases.  There is no pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube ends in a
     severely distended stomach.  Left and right internal jugular lines end in the
     region of the superior cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     56-year-old male with cirrhosis, ascites, ileus, and respiratory distress
     referred for evaluation of ascites versus dilated bowel.
     
     FINDINGS:  Focused ultrasound scanning of the four abdominal quadrants
     demonstrates a mild amount of ascites.  Due to the presence of distended bowel
     loops in the lower quadrants the ascites is not deemed amenable to bedside
     drainage.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild amount of ascites, not amenable to bedside drainage due to
     the presence of multiple distended loops of bowel in the lower abdominal
     quadrants.
