Abdominal u/s: There is marked ascites seen. The liver itself 
appears with relatively normal echogenicity and no evidence of 
mass. Hepatofugal flow is noted within the right, left, and main 
portal veins. Vasculature appears patent, but with reversed 
flow. The right kidney measures 11.6 cm. The left kidney 
measures 10.9 cm. There is no hydronephrosis or stones. The 
gallbladder appears normal without evidence of stones. The 
common duct is not dilated. There is splenomegaly. Pancreas is 
not well visualized secondary to abdominal gas.

IMPRESSION:
1. Marked ascites consistent with cirrhosis.
2. Hepatofugal flow within the portal veins consistent with 
portal hypertension.
3. Splenomegaly.

TIPS: 1. Paracentesis with a total of 4.4 liters of ascitic 
fluid removed.
2. Successful placement of a transjugular intrahepatic 
portosystemic shunt between the right hepatic vein and main

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Ascites refractory to treatment. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8181**] [**Name (STitle) 281**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 674**]
     [**Last Name (LF) 675**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8182**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2263**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] and [**Doctor First Name 455**] [**Doctor Last Name 456**] d'Othee, with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising
     throughout the procedure. Arghavan [**Doctor Last Name 8183**], senior medical student, also
     assisted on the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table. A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm the patient, procedure and site. Standard sterile prep and drape of
     the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Using realtime ultrasound guidance
     and after 5 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, a 19-gauge needle was
     advanced into ascitic fluid in the right flank/lower quadrant. A 0.035-inch
     Bentson guidewire was advanced through the needle and the needle was exchanged
     for a 4-French Omniflush catheter. The wire was removed and the Omniflush
     catheter was attached to sequential evacuated bottles to perform paracentesis.
     Fluoroscopy showed the catheter tip to be located under the right
     hemidiaphragm. A total of 4.4 liters of ascites was removed during the
     procedure, and the catheter was eventually removed at the end of the TIPS
     procedure. As ascitic fluid was leaking from the tube site, a single 3-0 nylon
     suture was placed to seal the tract. This suture should be removed in 7 days.
     
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right neck. General anesthesia was
     performed by the anesthesiology team. Local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1%
     lidocaine. Ultrasound evaluation demonstrated the right internal jugular vein
     to be patent and compressible. Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle and the needle was
     exchanged for the micropuncture sheath. The in situ guidewire was exchanged
                                                                 (Over)

     for a 0.035-inch [**Doctor Last Name 100**] guidewire and the micropuncture sheath was exchanged
     for a 9-French vascular sheath. The vascular sheath was attached to continuous
     heparinized saline flush. A 4-French Cobra catheter was advanced through the
     vascular sheath and a 0.035-inch angled Glidewire was advanced through the
     Cobra catheter. The combination of catheter and guidewire was used to select
     the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. The Cobra catheter was
     exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8184**] balloon catheter and the [**Doctor Last Name 8184**] catheter was wedged
     peripherally in the liver. Wedged hepatic venograms in the anterior and
     subsequently the lateral projections were performed using carbon dioxide
     contrast. This confirmed placement within the right hepatic vein and confirmed
     that the right, left and main portal veins were patent with hepatofugal flow.
     This corresponds to the ultrasound performed earlier the same day. In
     addition, there were numerous dilated portal system collateral veins.
     
     [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5031**]-Ushida needle system was used to puncture the right portal vein by way
     of the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. Multiple passes were
     required before the right portal vein was successfully punctured. A 0.035-inch
     angled Glidewire was advanced into the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and then
     the [**Last Name (un) 5031**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] system was exchanged for a 4-French Cobra catheter. Then, the
     Glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz guidewire. The Cobra catheter was then
     positioned in the main portal vein at the confluence of the superior
     mesenteric vein (SMV) and splenic veins and portal venography was performed
     with iodinated contrast. This demonstrates patency of the right, left and main
     portal veins, splenic vein, IMV, and left gastric vein. The left gastric vein
     is dilated with gastric varices. In addition, numerous other collateral portal
     venous system pathways are demonstrated. The portal venogram also confirmed
     puncture of the right portal vein. The Cobra catheter was then exchanged for a
     4 mm x 4 cm angioplasty balloon over the Amplatz guidewire and the hepatic
     tract was sequentially dilated. This balloon was then exchanged for a 10 mm x
     6 cm angioplasty balloon and the tract was dilated sequentially to 10 mm.
     Then, the balloon catheter was exchanged for a 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent, which
     was deployed in the hepatic parenchymal tract over the Amplatz guidewire. This
     was then dilated with the 10 mm x 6 cm balloon.
     
     A post-stent portal venogram was performed which demonstrated patency of the
     stent with flow of contrast from the portal vein through the TIPS stent to the
     right hepatic vein. There was ongoing opacification of portal venous system
     collaterals. Of note, pressure measurements were made prior to any balloon
     dilation of the hepatic parenchymal tract. At that time, predilation, portal
     venous pressure was 36 mm Hg and right hepatic venous pressure was 11 mm Hg
     for a gradient of 25 mm Hg. After deployment of the stent pressure
     measurements were repeated revealing a portal vein pressure of 34 mm Hg and a
     right hepatic vein pressure of 24 mm Hg for a gradient of 10 mm Hg. The portal
     venogram also demonstrated that the superior portion of the Wallstent was just
     within the hepatic vein just proximal to the puncture site. As such, we
                                                                 (Over)

     elected to place a second overlapping 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent. There was
     approximately 50% overlap and the proximal aspect of the second Wallstent was
     at the right hepatic vein just upstream of its insertion on the inferior vena
     cava. This Wallstent was also dilated with the 10 mm x 6 cm balloon.
     
     Portal venogram was then performed which demonstrated ongoing patency of the
     TIPS stents with decreased opacification of portal venous system collaterals.
     Pressure measurements obtained after the deployment of the second stent
     demonstrated a portal venous pressure of 30 mm Hg and a right hepatic venous
     pressure of 21 mm Hg for a gradient of 9 mm Hg. Following this, the 9-French
     vascular sheath was exchanged over wire for a 9-French triple-lumen central
     venous catheter with its tip positioned in the superior vena using
     fluoroscopic guidance. All 3 ports of the catheter flushed and aspirated well,
     were capped, and hep-locked. The catheter was sutured in place with two 2-0
     silk sutures and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.
     
     MEDICATIONS: A total of 330 mL of Optiray 320 intravenous contrast was
     utilized during the procedure. A total of 60 cc of intravenous carbon dioxide
     was utilized during the procedure. A total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1%
     subcutaneously was utilized during the procedure.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Paracentesis with a total of 4.4 liters of ascitic fluid removed.
     
     2.  Successful placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
     between the right hepatic vein and main portal vein by way of the right portal
     vein. A total of two 10 x 68 mm Wallstents were used in overlap and were
     balloon dilated to 10mm.
     
     3.  A 9-French triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed through the
     right internal jugular venous access with tip in the superior vena cava. The
     catheter may be used immediately.
     
     4. A single 3-0 nylon suture was placed at the paracentesis site in the right
     lower quadrant of the abdomen. This can be removed in 7 days' time. Please
     note that another suture was in place in the right lower quadrant of the
     abdomen that was present prior to the beginning of today's procedure.

     assisted on the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table. A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm the patient, procedure and site. Standard sterile prep and drape of
     the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Using realtime ultrasound guidance
     and after 5 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, a 19-gauge needle was
     advanced into ascitic fluid in the right flank/lower quadrant. A 0.035-inch
     Bentson guidewire was advanced through the needle and the needle was exchanged
     for a 4-French Omniflush catheter. The wire was removed and the Omniflush
     catheter was attached to sequential evacuated bottles to perform paracentesis.
     Fluoroscopy showed the catheter tip to be located under the right
     hemidiaphragm. A total of 4.4 liters of ascites was removed during the
     procedure, and the catheter was eventually removed at the end of the TIPS
     procedure. As ascitic fluid was leaking from the tube site, a single 3-0 nylon
     suture was placed to seal the tract. This suture should be removed in 7 days.
     
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right neck. General anesthesia was
     performed by the anesthesiology team. Local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1%
     lidocaine. Ultrasound evaluation demonstrated the right internal jugular vein
     to be patent and compressible. Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle and the needle was
     exchanged for the micropuncture sheath. The in situ guidewire was exchanged
                                                                 (Over)

     for a 0.035-inch [**Doctor Last Name 100**] guidewire and the micropuncture sheath was exchanged
     for a 9-French vascular sheath. The vascular sheath was attached to continuous
     heparinized saline flush. A 4-French Cobra catheter was advanced through the
     vascular sheath and a 0.035-inch angled Glidewire was advanced through the
     Cobra catheter. The combination of catheter and guidewire was used to select
     the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. The Cobra catheter was
     exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8184**] balloon catheter and the [**Doctor Last Name 8184**] catheter was wedged
     peripherally in the liver. Wedged hepatic venograms in the anterior and
     subsequently the lateral projections were performed using carbon dioxide
     contrast. This confirmed placement within the right hepatic vein and confirmed
     that the right, left and main portal veins were patent with hepatofugal flow.
     This corresponds to the ultrasound performed earlier the same day. In
     addition, there were numerous dilated portal system collateral veins.
     
     [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5031**]-Ushida needle system was used to puncture the right portal vein by way
     of the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. Multiple passes were
     required before the right portal vein was successfully punctured. A 0.035-inch
     angled Glidewire was advanced into the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and then
     the [**Last Name (un) 5031**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] system was exchanged for a 4-French Cobra catheter. Then, the
     Glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz guidewire. The Cobra catheter was then
     positioned in the main portal vein at the confluence of the superior
     mesenteric vein (SMV) and splenic veins and portal venography was performed
     with iodinated contrast. This demonstrates patency of the right, left and main
     portal veins, splenic vein, IMV, and left gastric vein. The left gastric vein
     is dilated with gastric varices. In addition, numerous other collateral portal
     venous system pathways are demonstrated. The portal venogram also confirmed
     puncture of the right portal vein. The Cobra catheter was then exchanged for a
     4 mm x 4 cm angioplasty balloon over the Amplatz guidewire and the hepatic
     tract was sequentially dilated. This balloon was then exchanged for a 10 mm x
     6 cm angioplasty balloon and the tract was dilated sequentially to 10 mm.
     Then, the balloon catheter was exchanged for a 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent, which
     was deployed in the hepatic parenchymal tract over the Amplatz guidewire. This
     was then dilated with the 10 mm x 6 cm balloon.
     
     A post-stent portal venogram was performed which demonstrated patency of the
     stent with flow of contrast from the portal vein through the TIPS stent to the
     right hepatic vein. There was ongoing opacification of portal venous system
     collaterals. Of note, pressure measurements were made prior to any balloon
     dilation of the hepatic parenchymal tract. At that time, predilation, portal
     venous pressure was 36 mm Hg and right hepatic venous pressure was 11 mm Hg
     for a gradient of 25 mm Hg. After deployment of the stent pressure
     measurements were repeated revealing a portal vein pressure of 34 mm Hg and a
     right hepatic vein pressure of 24 mm Hg for a gradient of 10 mm Hg. The portal
     venogram also demonstrated that the superior portion of the Wallstent was just
     within the hepatic vein just proximal to the puncture site. As such, we
                                                                 (Over)

     elected to place a second overlapping 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent. There was
     approximately 50% overlap and the proximal aspect of the second Wallstent was
     at the right hepatic vein just upstream of its insertion on the inferior vena
     cava. This Wallstent was also dilated with the 10 mm x 6 cm balloon.
     
     Portal venogram was then performed which demonstrated ongoing patency of the
     TIPS stents with decreased opacification of portal venous system collaterals.
     Pressure measurements obtained after the deployment of the second stent
     demonstrated a portal venous pressure of 30 mm Hg and a right hepatic venous
     pressure of 21 mm Hg for a gradient of 9 mm Hg. Following this, the 9-French
     vascular sheath was exchanged over wire for a 9-French triple-lumen central
     venous catheter with its tip positioned in the superior vena using
     fluoroscopic guidance. All 3 ports of the catheter flushed and aspirated well,
     were capped, and hep-locked. The catheter was sutured in place with two 2-0
     silk sutures and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.
     
     MEDICATIONS: A total of 330 mL of Optiray 320 intravenous contrast was
     utilized during the procedure. A total of 60 cc of intravenous carbon dioxide

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      49 year old man with diuretic resistant ascites                                 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please place TIPS

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Ascites refractory to treatment. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8181**] [**Name (STitle) 281**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 674**]
     [**Last Name (LF) 675**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8182**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2263**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] and [**Doctor First Name 455**] [**Doctor Last Name 456**] d'Othee, with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising
     throughout the procedure. Arghavan [**Doctor Last Name 8183**], senior medical student, also
     assisted on the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table. A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm the patient, procedure and site. Standard sterile prep and drape of
     the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Using realtime ultrasound guidance
     and after 5 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, a 19-gauge needle was
     advanced into ascitic fluid in the right flank/lower quadrant. A 0.035-inch
     Bentson guidewire was advanced through the needle and the needle was exchanged
     for a 4-French Omniflush catheter. The wire was removed and the Omniflush
     catheter was attached to sequential evacuated bottles to perform paracentesis.
     Fluoroscopy showed the catheter tip to be located under the right
     hemidiaphragm. A total of 4.4 liters of ascites was removed during the
     procedure, and the catheter was eventually removed at the end of the TIPS
     procedure. As ascitic fluid was leaking from the tube site, a single 3-0 nylon
     suture was placed to seal the tract. This suture should be removed in 7 days.
     
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right neck. General anesthesia was
     performed by the anesthesiology team. Local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1%
     lidocaine. Ultrasound evaluation demonstrated the right internal jugular vein
     to be patent and compressible. Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle and the needle was
     exchanged for the micropuncture sheath. The in situ guidewire was exchanged
                                                                 (Over)

     for a 0.035-inch [**Doctor Last Name 100**] guidewire and the micropuncture sheath was exchanged
     for a 9-French vascular sheath. The vascular sheath was attached to continuous
     heparinized saline flush. A 4-French Cobra catheter was advanced through the
     vascular sheath and a 0.035-inch angled Glidewire was advanced through the
     Cobra catheter. The combination of catheter and guidewire was used to select
     the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. The Cobra catheter was
     exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8184**] balloon catheter and the [**Doctor Last Name 8184**] catheter was wedged
     peripherally in the liver. Wedged hepatic venograms in the anterior and
     subsequently the lateral projections were performed using carbon dioxide
     contrast. This confirmed placement within the right hepatic vein and confirmed
     that the right, left and main portal veins were patent with hepatofugal flow.
     This corresponds to the ultrasound performed earlier the same day. In
     addition, there were numerous dilated portal system collateral veins.
     
     [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5031**]-Ushida needle system was used to puncture the right portal vein by way
     of the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. Multiple passes were
     required before the right portal vein was successfully punctured. A 0.035-inch
     angled Glidewire was advanced into the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and then
     the [**Last Name (un) 5031**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] system was exchanged for a 4-French Cobra catheter. Then, the
     Glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz guidewire. The Cobra catheter was then
     positioned in the main portal vein at the confluence of the superior
     mesenteric vein (SMV) and splenic veins and portal venography was performed
     with iodinated contrast. This demonstrates patency of the right, left and main
     portal veins, splenic vein, IMV, and left gastric vein. The left gastric vein
     is dilated with gastric varices. In addition, numerous other collateral portal
     venous system pathways are demonstrated. The portal venogram also confirmed
     puncture of the right portal vein. The Cobra catheter was then exchanged for a
     4 mm x 4 cm angioplasty balloon over the Amplatz guidewire and the hepatic
     tract was sequentially dilated. This balloon was then exchanged for a 10 mm x
     6 cm angioplasty balloon and the tract was dilated sequentially to 10 mm.
     Then, the balloon catheter was exchanged for a 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent, which
     was deployed in the hepatic parenchymal tract over the Amplatz guidewire. This
     was then dilated with the 10 mm x 6 cm balloon.
     
     A post-stent portal venogram was performed which demonstrated patency of the
     stent with flow of contrast from the portal vein through the TIPS stent to the
     right hepatic vein. There was ongoing opacification of portal venous system
     collaterals. Of note, pressure measurements were made prior to any balloon
     dilation of the hepatic parenchymal tract. At that time, predilation, portal
     venous pressure was 36 mm Hg and right hepatic venous pressure was 11 mm Hg
     for a gradient of 25 mm Hg. After deployment of the stent pressure
     measurements were repeated revealing a portal vein pressure of 34 mm Hg and a
     right hepatic vein pressure of 24 mm Hg for a gradient of 10 mm Hg. The portal
     venogram also demonstrated that the superior portion of the Wallstent was just
     within the hepatic vein just proximal to the puncture site. As such, we
                                                                 (Over)

     elected to place a second overlapping 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent. There was
     approximately 50% overlap and the proximal aspect of the second Wallstent was
     at the right hepatic vein just upstream of its insertion on the inferior vena
     cava. This Wallstent was also dilated with the 10 mm x 6 cm balloon.
     
     Portal venogram was then performed which demonstrated ongoing patency of the
     TIPS stents with decreased opacification of portal venous system collaterals.
     Pressure measurements obtained after the deployment of the second stent
     demonstrated a portal venous pressure of 30 mm Hg and a right hepatic venous
     pressure of 21 mm Hg for a gradient of 9 mm Hg. Following this, the 9-French
     vascular sheath was exchanged over wire for a 9-French triple-lumen central
     venous catheter with its tip positioned in the superior vena using
     fluoroscopic guidance. All 3 ports of the catheter flushed and aspirated well,
     were capped, and hep-locked. The catheter was sutured in place with two 2-0
     silk sutures and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.
     
     MEDICATIONS: A total of 330 mL of Optiray 320 intravenous contrast was
     utilized during the procedure. A total of 60 cc of intravenous carbon dioxide
     was utilized during the procedure. A total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1%
     subcutaneously was utilized during the procedure.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Paracentesis with a total of 4.4 liters of ascitic fluid removed.
     
     2.  Successful placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
     between the right hepatic vein and main portal vein by way of the right portal
     vein. A total of two 10 x 68 mm Wallstents were used in overlap and were
     balloon dilated to 10mm.
     
     3.  A 9-French triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed through the
     right internal jugular venous access with tip in the superior vena cava. The
     catheter may be used immediately.
     
     4. A single 3-0 nylon suture was placed at the paracentesis site in the right
     lower quadrant of the abdomen. This can be removed in 7 days' time. Please
     note that another suture was in place in the right lower quadrant of the

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please place TIPS

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Ascites refractory to treatment. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8181**] [**Name (STitle) 281**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 674**]
     [**Last Name (LF) 675**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8182**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2263**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 431**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] and [**Doctor First Name 455**] [**Doctor Last Name 456**] d'Othee, with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] [**Name (STitle) 457**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising
     throughout the procedure. Arghavan [**Doctor Last Name 8183**], senior medical student, also
     assisted on the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table. A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm the patient, procedure and site. Standard sterile prep and drape of
     the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Using realtime ultrasound guidance
     and after 5 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, a 19-gauge needle was
     advanced into ascitic fluid in the right flank/lower quadrant. A 0.035-inch
     Bentson guidewire was advanced through the needle and the needle was exchanged
     for a 4-French Omniflush catheter. The wire was removed and the Omniflush
     catheter was attached to sequential evacuated bottles to perform paracentesis.
     Fluoroscopy showed the catheter tip to be located under the right
     hemidiaphragm. A total of 4.4 liters of ascites was removed during the
     procedure, and the catheter was eventually removed at the end of the TIPS
     procedure. As ascitic fluid was leaking from the tube site, a single 3-0 nylon
     suture was placed to seal the tract. This suture should be removed in 7 days.
     
     Standard sterile prep and drape of the right neck. General anesthesia was
     performed by the anesthesiology team. Local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1%
     lidocaine. Ultrasound evaluation demonstrated the right internal jugular vein
     to be patent and compressible. Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle and the needle was
     exchanged for the micropuncture sheath. The in situ guidewire was exchanged
                                                                 (Over)

     for a 0.035-inch [**Doctor Last Name 100**] guidewire and the micropuncture sheath was exchanged
     for a 9-French vascular sheath. The vascular sheath was attached to continuous
     heparinized saline flush. A 4-French Cobra catheter was advanced through the
     vascular sheath and a 0.035-inch angled Glidewire was advanced through the
     Cobra catheter. The combination of catheter and guidewire was used to select
     the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. The Cobra catheter was
     exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8184**] balloon catheter and the [**Doctor Last Name 8184**] catheter was wedged
     peripherally in the liver. Wedged hepatic venograms in the anterior and
     subsequently the lateral projections were performed using carbon dioxide
     contrast. This confirmed placement within the right hepatic vein and confirmed
     that the right, left and main portal veins were patent with hepatofugal flow.
     This corresponds to the ultrasound performed earlier the same day. In
     addition, there were numerous dilated portal system collateral veins.
     
     [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5031**]-Ushida needle system was used to puncture the right portal vein by way
     of the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. Multiple passes were
     required before the right portal vein was successfully punctured. A 0.035-inch
     angled Glidewire was advanced into the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and then
     the [**Last Name (un) 5031**]-[**Last Name (un) 5032**] system was exchanged for a 4-French Cobra catheter. Then, the
     Glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz guidewire. The Cobra catheter was then
     positioned in the main portal vein at the confluence of the superior
     mesenteric vein (SMV) and splenic veins and portal venography was performed
     with iodinated contrast. This demonstrates patency of the right, left and main
     portal veins, splenic vein, IMV, and left gastric vein. The left gastric vein
     is dilated with gastric varices. In addition, numerous other collateral portal
     venous system pathways are demonstrated. The portal venogram also confirmed
     puncture of the right portal vein. The Cobra catheter was then exchanged for a
     4 mm x 4 cm angioplasty balloon over the Amplatz guidewire and the hepatic
     tract was sequentially dilated. This balloon was then exchanged for a 10 mm x
     6 cm angioplasty balloon and the tract was dilated sequentially to 10 mm.
     Then, the balloon catheter was exchanged for a 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent, which
     was deployed in the hepatic parenchymal tract over the Amplatz guidewire. This
     was then dilated with the 10 mm x 6 cm balloon.
     
     A post-stent portal venogram was performed which demonstrated patency of the
     stent with flow of contrast from the portal vein through the TIPS stent to the
     right hepatic vein. There was ongoing opacification of portal venous system
     collaterals. Of note, pressure measurements were made prior to any balloon
     dilation of the hepatic parenchymal tract. At that time, predilation, portal
     venous pressure was 36 mm Hg and right hepatic venous pressure was 11 mm Hg
     for a gradient of 25 mm Hg. After deployment of the stent pressure
     measurements were repeated revealing a portal vein pressure of 34 mm Hg and a
     right hepatic vein pressure of 24 mm Hg for a gradient of 10 mm Hg. The portal
     venogram also demonstrated that the superior portion of the Wallstent was just
     within the hepatic vein just proximal to the puncture site. As such, we
                                                                 (Over)

     elected to place a second overlapping 10 mm x 6.8 cm Wallstent. There was
     approximately 50% overlap and the proximal aspect of the second Wallstent was
     at the right hepatic vein just upstream of its insertion on the inferior vena
     cava. This Wallstent was also dilated with the 10 mm x 6 cm balloon.
     
     Portal venogram was then performed which demonstrated ongoing patency of the
     TIPS stents with decreased opacification of portal venous system collaterals.
     Pressure measurements obtained after the deployment of the second stent
     demonstrated a portal venous pressure of 30 mm Hg and a right hepatic venous
     pressure of 21 mm Hg for a gradient of 9 mm Hg. Following this, the 9-French
     vascular sheath was exchanged over wire for a 9-French triple-lumen central
     venous catheter with its tip positioned in the superior vena using
     fluoroscopic guidance. All 3 ports of the catheter flushed and aspirated well,
     were capped, and hep-locked. The catheter was sutured in place with two 2-0
     silk sutures and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.
     
     MEDICATIONS: A total of 330 mL of Optiray 320 intravenous contrast was
     utilized during the procedure. A total of 60 cc of intravenous carbon dioxide
     was utilized during the procedure. A total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1%
     subcutaneously was utilized during the procedure.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Paracentesis with a total of 4.4 liters of ascitic fluid removed.
     
     2.  Successful placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
     between the right hepatic vein and main portal vein by way of the right portal
     vein. A total of two 10 x 68 mm Wallstents were used in overlap and were
     balloon dilated to 10mm.
     
     3.  A 9-French triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed through the
     right internal jugular venous access with tip in the superior vena cava. The
     catheter may be used immediately.
     
     4. A single 3-0 nylon suture was placed at the paracentesis site in the right
     lower quadrant of the abdomen. This can be removed in 7 days' time. Please
     note that another suture was in place in the right lower quadrant of the
     abdomen that was present prior to the beginning of today's procedure.
