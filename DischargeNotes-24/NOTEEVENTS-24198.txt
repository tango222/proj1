Admission Date:  [**2724-11-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2724-11-22**]

Date of Birth:   [**2641-10-4**]       Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old
white male with multiple medical problems, who had been in
his usual state of health except for a recent cough, when he
awoke this morning feeling very weak with no strength in his
legs.  He awoke and went to his bathroom where he was
attempting to urinate and collapsed secondary to weakness,
striking his head.  The patient denies ever losing
consciousness, but he remembers collapsing because of his
weakness in his legs. He denies any palpitations or chest
pain.

His wife witnessed the incident and notes that he was very
weak but completely alert and oriented, the only abnormality
being a deeper voice.  Upon arrival, EMS noted a blood sugar
of 50 and the patient was noted to be greatly improved with
administration of one amp of D50.

Since coming to the Emergency Department, the patient has
been complaining of intermittent and light chest heaviness
that he gets intermittently.  Regarding his blood sugar, the
patient reports having had only one previous episode of
hypoglycemia to his knowledge.  The patient is noted as
having a lighter than normal dinner last evening.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has had a recent cough but no chest
x-ray as an outpatient.  No fever or chills, no bright red
blood per rectum.

   cvvhd proceeded w/o incident until 4:15am when the system abruptly clotted off. the pt was removed from the prisma, and his quinton catheter was flushed. anticipate that cvvhd will be restarted at some point during the day. also of note overnoc, the pt became bradycardic w/hr's transiently falling into the high 40's. the team was made aware, and a repeat ekg was reportedly w/o change. the pt was repleted w/an additional 3amps of ca gluconate and his pressor was changed over to a levo qtt, and the bradycardia subsequently resolved. additionally the pt appears to have become hypothermic after the cvvhd was initiated last evening, and he eventually was placed on the bair hugger ~2am.

review of systems

respiratory-> pt remains intubated and vented on ac 12x600 w/peep7.5 and fio2 40%. srr 2-4/min. pt was suctioned q4hrs overnoc for small amts of thick, white sputum.

cardiac-> as noted above, pt was transiently bradycardic w/hr's 50-low 60's for ~2hrs until he received additional calcium repletion and his pressor was changed to levo. currently, hr 70-80's, nsr w/o ectopy. sbp range 90-110, maintaining a map >60 on ~2.7 mcqs/min of levo. of note, serial enzymes are trending downward.

neuro-> pt is very lightly sedated on propofol and fentanyl. he becomes acutely agitated whenever he is stimulated. he is mae but not responding to commands.

gi-> abd is soft, distended w/+bs. fs nepro tube feedings advanced to 20cc/hr and may be increased again after 8am. goal rate is 35cc/hr and promod is to be added to the nepro after the pt reaches his goal rate. ogt residuals are minimal @5-10cc q4hrs. no bm overnoc.

gu-> cvvhd is currently off although expect that it will be restarted later today. the ca gluconate qtt is also on hold pnding restarting of cvvhd. creat has improved overnoc to 4.8 (down from 5.8 yesterday). repeat mag, potassium, and phos levels were w/in normal range this morning.

id-> ?whether hypothermia is actually r/t sepsis although wbc is normal. vanco was added to abx regimen last noc. 

access-> several more attempts to place an a-line were unsuccessful last noc. the pt clearly needs the line while intubated and requiring frequent blood draws; this will need to be readdressed this morning. other lines: right sc quinton cath, left triple lumen ij, and left arm peripheral heplock.

social-> wife went home ~7pm last noc and has not called overnoc.

review of systems

respiratory-> pt was rested overnoc on psv10/5 w/fio2 40%. srr 20's w/tv ~400-600cc. he was suctioned q3-4hrs for large to copious amts of thick, white sputum. a repeat sputum spec was sent d/t change in the amt of secretions. also of note, am breathing trial was deferred this morning because of frequent episodes of tachypnea and agitation. 

cardiac-> levo qtt is currently turned off while the pt is maintaining a sbp >100 and a map >55. ?whether the addition of peep has been responsible for the pt's transient hypotension. hr 80-90's, sr w/no ectopy.

neuro-> pt is mae and inconsistently following commands. when awake, he is generally restless and agitated. he did receive a total of 4mg of haldol in devided doses overnoc w/fair effect on agitation.

gi-> abd is soft, nontender w/+bs. no bm overnoc. tube feedings have been on hold since 4am for a possible extubation. repeat hct this morning is trending downward to ~27.

gu-> uo for the shift was 50cc. plan for hemodialysis today; ?whether a blood transfusion during the treatment would improve hemodynamic stability. 

id-> wbc wnl again this morning. tmax 100 orally. the pt is being renally dosed w/vanco. would f/u on results of sputum cx.

Resp:  Pt was on PSV 10/Peep5 this am.  He was suctioned for a mod to large amount of white secretions q4h.  He was dialyzed without difficulty and was able to be placed on PSV 5/Peep 5 during dialysis.  They removed a total of 1.2 L of fluid and transfused 1 unit of RBC's for a total of 900cc removed.  He was placed on a ""T"" piece at 12:30 and then extubated at 1330.  He was initially placed on 50% cool neb then weaned to 2l NC with an O2 sat remaining at 99-100%.  He has a very junky cough which it appears to be productive but he does not expectorate the secretions.  His RR when asleep is 32-35 but can increase to 39-40 when agitated.

Gu: He was dialysed as above but continues to void in small amounts.  He had 75 cc of cloudy yellow urine before he pulled off the condom cath and was incontinent in the bed.

Cardiac: B/P increased during dialysis to 110-120/40's with HR 87-100.  Following extubation his HR increased to 110's ST.  He did not require any levo today.

GI:  The NGT was D/C'ed with the ETT.  He remains NPO until he is more responsive.  He stooled X2, first was formed black OB (+) and the second was loose black stool.

Neuro:  PT is alert but he is not cooperative.  He follows commands occasionally and continues to hit and pinch whenever he gets the opportunity.  Following extubation he has not spoken many words except OUCH, get away from me, and some incomprehensible sounds.

Lines: The A-line had a very good tracing but during dialysis it started to bleed from around the catheter.  By the time dialysis ended there was a very large clot under the dressing with a large spot on the bed.  A pressure dressing was applied which stopped the bleeding until he started getting agitated and it bled quite a bit.  The A-line was D/C'ed following extubation before getting a post extubation ABG due to the bleeding.

Social: His wife came at 12n and stayed until 6pm.  She is pleased with his progress and knows that he may be called out in the am

Plan:  Monitor resp status, he may need NT suctioning.  Monitor cardiac status.  Probable call out in am.

review of symptoms

respiratory-> lung exam is c/w scattered expiratory wheezing which have not improved w/neb treatments. he is maintaining sats >97% on 2l o2 via cannula although his respiratory rate has fallen to 32/min only while he is sleeping. ?need to ultrafiltrate today to remove more fluid.
