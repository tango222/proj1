History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 40 year old man with AIDS (criteria of CD-4 counts 
and opportunistic infections) who is being admitted for dyspnea,
fevers, and hypoxia.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] says that he was in his usual state of (chronically
poor) health until about 3 days ago when he began to have more
fatigue than usual. He then began to have fevers up to 
99.0-100.0
and yesterday started to develop left sided chest pain that came
on with deep breaths and coughing, and fevers up to 103 degrees
with chills but no rigors. He is coughing up scant, thick yellow
sputum, without any blood in the sputum.

He came to the Infectious Disease Outpatient Clinic this morning
and was found to have a temp of 102 degrees, and an oxygen
saturation after walking down the hallway that was 71.%. He was
brought to the Emergency Room and admitted from there.

He was last hospitalized here from [**6-22**] -> [**2916-6-29**] for persistent
pain from a right-sided kidney stone. During the hospital-
ization, he had a stent placed into the right kidney to help
remove the stone. The stent was removed prior to his discharge.
A chest X ray during that admission revealed a faint opacity in
the left lower lobe that obscured the left hemidiaphragm on the
lateral view. He was, therefore, put on cefpodixime for 7 days.""
 
In ER VSS were temp of 101.7 HR of 99 BP 112/72  R24, 74% on RA, 
99% on 2L.  Cxray notable for LLL infiltrate. EKG notable for 
sinus tach at 92, negative axis, R wave transition in v3, flat T 
waves V5-V6, q3T3, q in 2/3/avf (no change from baseline). INR 
was 0.9. Cr of 1.6. Blood cultures were sent. In ed received 
tylenol, ceftriaxone 2mg iv, MS contin and heparin IV. 
40 M w/AIDS (CD4 count of 9 on [**2916-4-16**]) admitted [**8-20**] for 
dyspnea, fevers to 103, and hypoxia. (In [**Hospital **] clinic with 
temperature of 102 degrees and ambulatory o2 sat of 71%. Please 
see ID admit note in OMR for complete HPI/history.) In short, 
patient was in his usual state of health until three days prior 
to admission when he experienced more fatigue, fevers up to 
99.0-100.0, pleuritic chest pain and cough. (Patient was last 
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 25**] from [**6-22**] to [**2916-6-29**] for persistent pain 
from a right-sided kidney stone, a stent was placed and 
removed.)
 
In ER on admission: VSS were temp of 101.7 HR of 99 BP 112/72 
R24, 74% on RA, 99% on 2L. Chest xray was notable for LLL 
infiltrate. EKG notable for sinus tach at 92, negative axis, R 
wave transition in v3, flat T waves V5-V6, q3T3, q in 2/3/avf 
(no change from baseline). INR was 0.9. Cr of 1.6. In the ed the 
patient received tylenol, ceftriaxone 2mg IV, MS contin and 
heparin IV. 

ROS: Man with HIV/AIDS last CD4 count of 9.  On transfer to the 
east campus patient continues to express sharp chest pain in 
left sternal area radiating to left shoulder [**4-30**] in intensity 
worse with inspiration, patient also reports not some SOB. 
Patient reports intermittent hematuria. He denies abdominal 
pain, diarrhea, melena, headache, sore throat, dysuria, lower 
extremity swelling or pain, orthopnea.

Brief Hospital Course:
40 M w/ AIDS (CD4 of 9), multiple medical problems presents with 
dypnea and fever.  

SOB - On the floor antibiotic was changed to cefipime. One day 
following admission, patient developed additional chest pain and 
hypoxia initially read in o2 sat of 70s requiring 10L of O2 at 
which patient was 93% (abg was 7.35/34/90 on 10L face-mask), 
patient's systolic blood pressure was also in 100s compared to 
baseline of 130s. Unclear if relative hypotension was secondary 
to pain medications, dehydration, developing heart failure from 
possible PE, verus worsening PNA, therefore patient was 
transferred to unit.

In FICU supportive measures were continued. The patient was 
provided with IV fluid.  Empiric treatment for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 
(primaquine) but then discontinued.  CT on [**8-22**] showed: LLL 
PNA, effusion, enlargement of nodule at left lung apex and new 
nodule in the medial LUL nodule, possibly representing 
differences in slice selection compared to [**9-23**]. Patient will 
need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3258**] regarding further work-up of 
these findings.  (A contrast CT was not performed secondary to 
the patient's CRI.) Labs on [**8-24**] notable for HCT 25.5, Retic 
0.7, LDH normal, INR of 1.6,  Cr at 1.6 (down from elevated 1.9 
on admission), of note Trop maximum at 0.83 and an echo was 
performed on [**8-22**] which demonstrated normal systolic function, 
therefore felt to represent possible RV strain. Patient's 
respiratory status improved on antibiotics and patients 
transferred out of unit. Of note cryptococcal antigen was 
negative.  Nasopharyngeal culture for ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3 
INFLUENZA A,B AND RSV was negative. CMV DNA was negative.  
Patient o2 sat was 94% while ambulating on discharged but with 
subjective feeling of intermittent dyspnea we discharge with 
oxygen.  Patient will also be discharged on Lovenox SC, until 
INR is therapeutic.  A picc line was placed on discharge for 
outpatient cefipime.  
 
2. Fever - Patient with AIDS, history of fever and chest 
xray/chest CT notable for PNA. Blood cultures / urine cultures 
in-house were negative.  Patient without diarrhea.  Reticulocyte 
low, LDH normal, D bili was slightly elevated.  

3. CRI/Hematuria - Patient with a history of renal stones, 
recent admission for kidney stone and urthethral stent presents 
with elevated CR compared to baseline. The etiology was likely 
prerenal as patient responded to fluids. On discharge CR was 1.3 
(baseline 1.3-1.8).

4. Cardiac/CAD - Of note patient with a history of RCA stent, 
IMI in past, q waves on inferior leads on EKG. Patient is not 
maintained on cardiac medications secondary to concerns 
regarding drug interactions (discussed with attending). Patient 
experienced elevated troponins during episodes of chest pain. An 
echo demonstrated intact systolic function. Patient discharged 
on aspirin.

5. HIV - Patient on antiretroviral medications tonofovir, 
stavudine, ritonavir, Fuzeon, Emtricitabine, Atazanavir. Patient 
is on empiric AIDS coverage with cipro, azithro, acyclovir. 

6. Neurology/History of seizure - Maintain on kepra. Seizure 
thought to be due to a focus from scar of a prior brain abscess. 
Patient reports using gabapentin for neuropathic pain.  

7. Anemia - Patient presented with a hematocrit of 34, wide 
variation in baseline (34-44). Throughout hospitalization 
hematocrit went down to 25 but stabilized.  This decrease likely 
reprented fluid shifts from hydration.  The differential for 
anemia includes low production given anemia of chronic disease, 
low reticulocyte count. Iron studies demonstrated low iron, low 
b12. Therefore b12 was provided. Patient has history of procrit 
use which will be resumed on discharge.  

10. Code - DNR/DNI.

     COMPARISON:  [**2914-10-31**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color, and Doppler imaging of the left common femoral,
     superficial femoral, deep femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.  Normal
     flow and compressibility are demonstrated within the left common femoral vein.
      Within the left superficial femoral vein, extending from the proximal portion
     of the superficial femoral vein to the popliteal vein, there is echogenic
     mural thrombus.  This is located in the regions previously involved with
     thrombosis.  The non- thrombosed portions of the veins are compressible, and
     there is color flow adjacent to the area of thrombus. The appearance is
     suggestive of chronic thrombus. Normal color flow, compressibility, and
     waveforms are demonstrated within the deep femoral vein. In addition, multiple
     small collaterals are visualized adjacent to the thrombosed superficial
     femoral vein, containing color flow.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Chronic deep venous thrombosis extending from the proximal left
     superficial femoral vein to the left popliteal vein, with multiple
     collaterals.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY:  HIV positive patient with acute shortness of breath and history of
     recurrent pulmonary embolism.  History of lupus anticoagulent antibody.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2915-9-26**] and [**2915-9-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT scan of the chest was performed without
     contrast.  Intravenous contrast was withheld due to the patient's renal
     failure.
     
     CHEST CT w/o CONTRAST:  There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal or
     axillary lymph nodes. Pulmonary vasculature cannot be evaluated in the absence
     of intravenous contrast. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a small
     left pleural effusion. There is a combination of atelectasis and consolidation
     in the left lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia. The airways are patent to
     the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     Multiple small pulmonary nodules are again seen. The majority of the nodules
     appear smaller or unchanged in size compared to [**2915-9-26**]. However, the most
     superior nodule in the left upper lobe, at the lateral left lung apex,
     measures 6 x 6 mm, which is slightly larger than on [**2915-9-26**].  There is also a
     new 4 x 4 mm nodule just lateral to the proximal left subclavian artery. These
     differences may be secondary to slice selection. Unfortunately, chest CT scans
     performed in [**2913**] cannot be currently retrieved from the PACS archiving system
     for further comparison. Comparison to those studies is recommended when
     feasible.
     
     A large cyst is again partially visualized in the upper pole of the right
     kidney.  The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
     glands, and left kidney appear unremarkable.  The visualized osseous
     structures are also unremarkable.
     
     The findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 928**] at 2:30 PM on [**2916-8-22**].
     
     IMPRESSION
     
     1.  Left lower lobe pneumonia and a small left pleural effusion.
     
     2.  Slight enlargement of a small nodule at the left lung apex and a new
     nodule in the medial left upper lobe nodule, possibly representing differences

     sterile fashion. Under ultrasonographic guidance, after administration of 1%
     lidocaine a 21 gauge needle was advanced into the right brachial vein. The
     measuring guide wire was introduced through the needle, but could not be
     advanced into the right brachial vein. This was exchanged for an .018 Nitinol
     wire which also could not be advanced. Subsequently an .018 glide wire was
     used, which was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the distal SVC. The
     needle was exchanged for a 4 Fr sheath. It was determined that a length of 35
     cm would be suitable. A 4 Fr single-lumen PICC line was advanced over the wire
     and the peelaway sheath removed using fluoroscopic guidance. The wire was
     removed and chest x- ray obtained which demonstrated tip of the PICC line to
     be in the distal superior vena cava. The line was flushed and heplocked, and
     secured with a StatLock. The line is ready for use.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.

     line with tip in distal SVC, ready for use.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  AIDS.  PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 933**] of breath.  
     
     Compared to [**2916-8-21**].
     
     The heart size is normal.  There is a rounded configuration of the left hilum,
     which appears stable.  The right hilar contour and medistinal contours are
     normal.  The lungs demonstrate interval improvement in previously present left
     lower lobe opacity with residual hazy areas of opacity remaining.  On the
     lateral view this appears somewhat more confluent, however.  The right lung is
     grossly clear, except for a small granuloma in the right upper lobe and a
     peripheral area of linear opacity in the right mid lung zone.
     
     Review of the patient's Radiology folder reveals that a chest CT was performed
     on [**2916-8-21**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Improving left lower lobe process, likely due to resolving pneumonia.
     
     2. Rounded appearance of left hilar region. When available, direct comparison
     will be made to the [**2916-8-22**], CT scan, and an addendum will be issued
     to this report.
     
     ADDENDUM: The left hilum appears stable to the scout image of the CT scan.
     This may be due to prominent vessels, but it is difficult to exclude lymph
     node enlargement as the CT was performed without intravenous contrast.

      No renal calculus seen or hydronephrosis. Study limited because it is non-
      contrast but there is subtle stranding about the right kidney. This maybe
      old/chronic though as the patient had a CT in [**2916-5-21**] which showed acute
      changes at that time related to right ureteral stone. Please correlate with
      UA. No definite bowel abnormality; no obstruction or mesenteric stranding.
      Shoddy retroperitoneal nodes are unchanged from prior report. I am at 42563
      for questions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lower abdominal pain, AIDS, and fever.  The patient has history
     of kidney stones and had flank pain yesterday.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2916-6-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with oral contrast only.  IV contrast was not administered due to the
     patient's rising creatinine of 2.2.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were
     obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is scarring and atelectasis at
     the lung bases.  There are coronary artery calcifications.  The noncontrast-
     enhanced liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenals are normal.  There
     is a large hypodense cyst of the right upper pole of the kidney that is not
     well characterized on this noncontrast-enhanced study, but likely unchanged.
     The right kidney remains slightly enlarged compared to the left. There is
     stranding about the right kidney, which may indicate the recent passage of a
     stone, though no radiopaque stones are identified.  There is no
     hydronephrosis. The stomach and proximal small bowel are unremarkable.  No
     free air within the abdomen.  Small and large bowel are unremarkable.  At the
     hepatic flexure, there is a small area of focal colonic wall thickening that
     is likely related to focal peristalsis. There are small retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes present that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  They
     measure up to 8 mm in short axis.  There are also small lymph nodes at the
     porta hepatis.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid, and bladder are
     unremarkable.  No free fluid within the pelvis, and no pathologically enlarged
     lymph nodes.  The appendix is not visualized, though there is no stranding
                                                                 (Over)

     within the right lower quadrant.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is an unusual appearance of the femoral heads
     bilaterally, which may be related to prior trauma or avascular necrosis.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy in
     this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Stranding about the right kidney, without radiopaque renal or ureteric
     stone present.  Note that Indinavir stones are radiolucent. The findings may
     be related to recent stone passage or a radiolucent stone.
     
     2)  No evidence of appendicitis or diverticulitis.
     
     3)  Small lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum and at the porta hepatis.
     
     4)  Coronary artery calcifications.
     
     5)  Abnormal appearance of the femoral heads, which may be related to prior
     trauma or avascular necrosis.

      No renal calculus seen or hydronephrosis. Study limited because it is non-
      contrast but there is subtle stranding about the right kidney. This maybe
      old/chronic though as the patient had a CT in [**2916-5-21**] which showed acute
      changes at that time related to right ureteral stone. Please correlate with
      UA. No definite bowel abnormality; no obstruction or mesenteric stranding.
      Shoddy retroperitoneal nodes are unchanged from prior report. I am at 42563
      for questions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lower abdominal pain, AIDS, and fever.  The patient has history
     of kidney stones and had flank pain yesterday.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2916-6-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with oral contrast only.  IV contrast was not administered due to the
     patient's rising creatinine of 2.2.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were
     obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is scarring and atelectasis at
     the lung bases.  There are coronary artery calcifications.  The noncontrast-
     enhanced liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenals are normal.  There
     is a large hypodense cyst of the right upper pole of the kidney that is not
     well characterized on this noncontrast-enhanced study, but likely unchanged.
     The right kidney remains slightly enlarged compared to the left. There is
     stranding about the right kidney, which may indicate the recent passage of a
     stone, though no radiopaque stones are identified.  There is no
     hydronephrosis. The stomach and proximal small bowel are unremarkable.  No
     free air within the abdomen.  Small and large bowel are unremarkable.  At the
     hepatic flexure, there is a small area of focal colonic wall thickening that
     is likely related to focal peristalsis. There are small retroperitoneal lymph
     nodes present that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  They
     measure up to 8 mm in short axis.  There are also small lymph nodes at the
     porta hepatis.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid, and bladder are
     unremarkable.  No free fluid within the pelvis, and no pathologically enlarged
     lymph nodes.  The appendix is not visualized, though there is no stranding
                                                                 (Over)

      attacks.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please do an MRI of the head with and without contrast to evaluate for source 
      of ?seizures. Please compare to old MRIs of the head which were notable for MAC 
      lesions, also evaluate medial temporal lobes for possible seizure foci and MTS. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  AIDS and mycobacterium infection with anxiety attacks awakening
     him from [**Doctor Last Name 937**].  MRI to evaluate there is a source of seizures.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted imaging of the brain was performed.
     
     Comparison is made to the most recent previous CT scan of the brain from
     [**2912-12-25**] and an MRI from [**2912-3-4**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There are multiple foci of increased T2 signal in the periventricular and
     subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.  This finding was
     present on the older examinations.  The ventricles are prominent, and the
     sulci are widened, consistent with diffuse brain atrophy.  There is also a
     right subdural CSF signal intensity collection, which was present on the older
     exam and is probably about the same size and shape as on the [**2912-12-25**] CT.
     Though the subdural collection mildly impresses the right superior cerebral
     hemisphere, there is no definite shift of midline structures and the basal
     cisternal spaces are wide.
     
     Post-contrast images reveal no abnormal intracranial enhancement.  There is no
     asymmetry of the temporal lobes identified.  There is no susceptibility
     artifact to indicate the presence of blood products.  No diffusion signal
     abnormality is seen to suggest recent infarction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes that are consistent with HIV infection.  No
     evidence of abnormal intracranial enhancement.

     HISTORY:  HIV, needs IV foscarnet.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 281**], and
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout.  The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the
     usual sterile fashion.  Because no suitable superficial veins were visible,
     ultrasound was used to find a suitable vein.  The right brachial vein was
     patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine,
     the brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge
     needle.  Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained documenting patent
     vein before and after establishing an access.  Attempts were made to pass a
     0.018 guide wire, then  subsequently a nitinol guide wire under fluoroscopy;
     however, there was resistance met in the wire within the upper arm. Therefore,
     5 cc of contrast was injected manually through the access needle under
     fluoroscopy to help map the course of the vein.  A 0.018-angled Glidewire was
     then advanced under fluoroscopy to the superior vena cava.  It was determined
     that a length of 41 cm would be suitable.  Attempts were made to pass a 4-
     French introducer sheath over the Glidewire without success secondary to the
     toughness of the patient's fascia.  After dilatation of the access tract, a
     micropuncture sheath, 5-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
     Glidewire to the brachial vein.  The PICC was advanced through the sheath
     under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was
     removed, and the catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was obtained
     demonstrating the tip to be in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready for
     use.  A StatLock was applied, and line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 41 cm total length right brachial PICC,
     with tip in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready for use.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      41 year old man with hx.of thyroid CA who needs Foscarnet for skin infection.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt needs PICC for foscarnet. IV RN attempted to place picc at bedside, unable
      to thread wire.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY:  HIV, needs IV foscarnet.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 281**], and
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 489**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout.  The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the
     usual sterile fashion.  Because no suitable superficial veins were visible,
     ultrasound was used to find a suitable vein.  The right brachial vein was
     patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine,
     the brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge
     needle.  Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained documenting patent
     vein before and after establishing an access.  Attempts were made to pass a
     0.018 guide wire, then  subsequently a nitinol guide wire under fluoroscopy;
     however, there was resistance met in the wire within the upper arm. Therefore,
     5 cc of contrast was injected manually through the access needle under
     fluoroscopy to help map the course of the vein.  A 0.018-angled Glidewire was
     then advanced under fluoroscopy to the superior vena cava.  It was determined
     that a length of 41 cm would be suitable.  Attempts were made to pass a 4-
     French introducer sheath over the Glidewire without success secondary to the
     toughness of the patient's fascia.  After dilatation of the access tract, a
     micropuncture sheath, 5-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
     Glidewire to the brachial vein.  The PICC was advanced through the sheath
     under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was
     removed, and the catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was obtained
     demonstrating the tip to be in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready for
     use.  A StatLock was applied, and line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 41 cm total length right brachial PICC,
     with tip in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready for use.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY DATED [**2917-7-22**] is COMPARED TO [**2917-2-5**]:  The heart,
     hilar, and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no prominence of
     the pulmonary vasculature to suggest congestive heart failure.  The lung
     fields are now clear without focal opacity to suggest infiltrate.  The
     surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable.  The surrounding soft tissue
     structures show there has been interval movement of the right subclavian PICC
     line, which now terminates in the right subclavian vein instead of the
     superior vena cava.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality including infiltrate.
     Interval partial withdrawal of right PICC line, which now terminates in the
     right subclavian vein instead the superior vena cava.

     HISTORY: 41 yo man with elevated creatinine; presenting with pleuritic chest  
     pain.  History of HIV and antiphospholipid syndrome; evaluate for pulmonary
     embolism.  
       
     INTERPRETATION:  
     Ventilation images obtained with Tc-99m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate diffuse
     patchy areas of decreased tracer uptake.  There is also a focal area of
     decreased tracer uptake in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe.  
       
     Perfusion images in the same 8 views show matched areas of decreased perfusion. 
       
     Chest x-ray shows no significant abnormalities.  
       
     IMPRESSION:Low likelihood of pulmonary embolism; matched perfusion and 
     ventilation defects in the left upper lobe as well as diffuse patchy areas of
     matched defects are likely secondary to airways disease.
