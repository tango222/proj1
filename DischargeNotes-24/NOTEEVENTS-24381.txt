was clear.  No otorrhea or rhinorrhea.  The neck was supple.
No lymphadenopathy.  No cervical spine tenderness.

head revealed a small right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Computed tomography angiogram revealed no pulmonary embolism.
The pericardium was normal.  Decreased size and multiple
pleural-based lesions consistent with known adenocarcinoma.

Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 81 beats
per minute, normal intervals, and normal axis.  No acute ST-T
wave abnormalities.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE ISSUES:  A Neurosurgery
consultation was obtained.  The patient had every 1-hour
neurologic checks in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The

platelets and coagulations were monitored and remained
normal.

She had a repeat head computed tomography on hospital day two
which showed complete resolution of the subarachnoid
hemorrhage and no additional injuries.  The patient was
remained neurologically intact throughout her
hospitalization.

vasovagal/orthostatic.  The patient had no evidence of
tamponade on chest computed tomography.  The patient was
monitored on telemetry with no events.  Her enzymes were
negative times two.

She had an echocardiogram which showed a small aortic
gradient consistent with minimal aortic stenosis which was
deemed unlikely to have caused her syncopal symptoms.  A
carotid ultrasound was obtained which showed no evidence of
stenosis in either carotid artery.
