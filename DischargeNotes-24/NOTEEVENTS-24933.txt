Date of Birth:   [**2715-11-26**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with
past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
and bladder stones who was brought into the hospital with a
temperature of 101.5 and generalized fatigue.

In the ER he was found to be satting 78% on room air.  His
fever increased to 103.4.  He became delirious.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Mild anemia.
5.  Nephrolithiasis.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
7.  Diverticulosis.
8.  Coronary artery disease.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Accupril.
2.  Proscar.
3.  Synthroid.
4.  Aspirin.
5.  Lasix.
6.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
7.  Flomax.
8.  Vitamin E.
9.  Vitamin B.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lived in an assisted living home.  He is
a retired pulmonologist.  Feeds himself but needs assistance
with all activities of daily living.

LABORATORY AND STUDIES DATA:  Chest x-ray showed aspiration
pneumonitis versus acute pulmonary edema.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 103.4, blood pressure
and heart rate are stable, sat is 78% on room air which
increased to 100% on 6 liters.  Exam:  Cardiac:  Irregular
rate; II/VI systolic murmur.  Chest:  Diffuse rhonchi
throughout; expiratory wheezes; no focal rales.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  Fevers:  The patient was started on Clindamycin and
Levaquin.  Blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures
were sent.  The patient also was cultured for influenza.  It
ended up being positive.  He was started on Amantadine, and
he completed a course of Amantadine as well as a seven-day
course of Clindamycin, Levaquin, and Ceftriaxone.

2.  Desaturation:  The patient was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure.  He was extubated on [**2811-11-30**] as he
and his family decided to make him comfort measures only.

3.  Hypertension:  The patient had episode of hypertension
with his acute hypoxia.  He was started on Accupril and
Lasix.  During his hospital course he had to be placed on a
nitro drip for blood pressure control.  The nitro drip was
discontinued on [**2811-11-29**].

For his atrial fibrillation he was continued on aspirin and
beta blocker.  For his benign prostatic hypertrophy he was
continued on his Proscar and Flomax.

The patient passed away on [**2811-11-30**] when the family decided
that he had been optimally medically managed, and they felt
that he would not make meaningful recovery.  The patient was
pronounced at 3:56 p.m. on [**2811-11-30**].

     INDICATION:  Respiratory failure.
     
     COMPARISON made to previous study of 2 days earlier.
     
     The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval.  There is
     increased caliber to the pulmonary vascularity with associated parahilar
     haziness.  Additionally, there is a more confluent area of opacification in
     the left retrocardiac region which is worsened in the interval and there has
     also been associated development of a small left pleural effusion.  Ill-
     defined peripheral opacities in the right upper lung zone are unchanged, as
     well as right apical pleural opacity.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Worsening perihilar haziness attributed to worsening pulmonary edema.
     
     2)  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity which may be related to atelectasis or
     pneumonia.
     
     3)  Persistent peripheral right upper lobe pleural and parenchymal opacities
     of uncertain chronicity, unchanged since recent radiographs.  Or possibly the
     sequelae of previous tuberculosis infection cannot be excluded without  older
     films for comparison.  By report, older chest radiographs of [**2809-12-17**].
     describe some scarring in both apices.  Obtaining the older radiographs would
     be helpful to document long term stability.  These films are being requested
     and an addendum can be issued to the report when they become available.

Events

 [**Age over 90 **] y/o Pt transferred to MICU for supportive care for hypoxia r/t pna (pt has infiltrates on xray). Pt started on BIPAP upon arrival to MICU, did not tolerate this well at all. Pt became increasingly tachypneic (RR 40's), hypertensive and tachycardic. HO notified. PT then received 1 mg of Versed w/ minimal effect. BIPAP stopped, pt placed on NRB and face mask. ABG sent at that time- 7.41/40/57/26. Pts sats when sent 90%. Shortly there after pt's sats increased to 98%. HO placed an aline. BLD cx x2, cardiac enzymes, lytes and PTT checked. CPK remains elevated at 2051, but this is a decrease from earlier (2200). PT also had urine cx and influenza screening done. Pt's daughter at bedside for much of this and updated by nsg and team on status and plan of care.


Review of Systems

Neuro- Pt has dementia and is intermittently agitated. .5 mg of Haldol ordered and may be given if needed. PERRLA, bsk. Does not consistently follow commands but is always arousable. MAE.

CV- HR 60-70's, NSR, freq ectopy.  BP 160-170's. Has lopressor ordered q 4 hrs IVP, also has an order for NITro gtt to be started if hypertension persists. Goal BP less than 140. Plan to recheck labs as odered and cont to cycle cardiac enzymes.  

Resp- Cont on 6 L NC and NRB. LS coarse w/ rhonchi, crackles in bases. Sats presently 98%, cont to follow closely. PT may be a candidate for intubation, daughter aware. 

GI- NPO- aspiration risk. ABd soft, +BS, +Sm bwn BM.

GU- Adequate u/o/hr, please refer to CV for FB. Since arrival to MICU pt has had > 100 cc/u/o/hr. Pt has tugged on foley and urine is bld stained. US of Kidneys done today- results pending.

SKin- Breakdown noted on sacrum, duoderm applied. PT also had bleeding cut on R lower arm, antibiotic crm and gauze applied.

Plan-  Cont supportive medical care, follow up on all labs w. team. Cont to monitor resp and CV status closely.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient intubated.  Check for pulmonary infiltrates.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP semiupright image.  Comparison study dated [**2811-11-26**].  The ET tube, right subclavian central line and NG line all remain in good
     position.  The heart again shows marked LV enlargement.  There are extensive
     ill-defined interstitial and some alveolar pulmonary infiltrates in both
     lungs, slightly worsened since the prior study, particularly on the left side.
      There is associated pleural thickening and apical fibrosis at the right lung
     apex, probably due to old granulomatous disease.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. The findings are suggestive of pulmonary edema, presumably on the basis of
     left ventricular decompensation.
     
     2. Background right apical scarring and pleural thickening, probably due to
     old tuberculosis.
     
     3. Satisfactory placement of lines.

Events

 PTs daughter met w/ PMICU attending and intern last evening and was updated on pt's status. Per retport from ICU attending; plan of care was also discussed and it was decided that pt would remain a full code o/n. He cont to be diuresed to optimize status for extubation today. Prior to extubation, pt will be made a DNR/DNI. According to pt's daughter, he would not want long term aggressive interventions to maintain his life. Pt's grandson will be visiting today prior to extubation and pt's daughter would like to be present for extubation.
