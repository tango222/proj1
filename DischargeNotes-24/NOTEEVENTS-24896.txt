   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2900-5-5**] 8:51 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: r/o ischemic bowel 
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman with abd pain RLQ s/p Cardiac cath/R groin, 
and flu, w/ Elevated WBC count, and HCT drop 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ischemic bowel 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 73-year-old woman with abdominal pain, right lower 
quadrant, status post cardiac catheterization and elevated 
lactate and white blood cell count. Please evaluate for ischemic 
bowel.

COMPARISON: [**2900-5-2**].

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the abdomen and 
pelvis was compared to [**2900-5-2**].

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There are new moderate sized bilateral 
pleural effusions with bilateral atelectasis that is moderate in 
severity. Patient is status post recent CABG with chest tubes in 
the mediastinum. The liver enhances homogeneously. There is a 
small amount of ascites. The density of the gallbladder is 
increased suggesting sludge. There is minimal pericholecystic 
fluid. The common bile duct is not clearly seen but does not 
appear dilated. The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, stomach, are 
unchanged from [**2900-5-2**]. The small bowel loops are normal 
caliber. Examination of the small bowel wall is somewhat limited 
secondary to artifact from previous contrast in the colon, but 
there is no evidence for pneumatosis or small bowel wall 
thickening. There is no portal venous air. A large heterogeneous 
retroperitoneal structure representing a hematoma is unchanged 
in size from [**2900-5-2**].

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a new ascites in the pelvis. 
There is evidence for anasarca throughout the soft tissues. 
Evaluation of the large bowel wall is somewhat limited due to 
artifact from retained contrast. The bowel is caliber is normal. 
Evaluation for pneumatosis and bowel wall thickening is limited. 
The distal ureters and bladder are normal. A Foley is present in 
the bladder. Air is present throughout the medial and anterior 
compartment of the thigh. This is likely secondary to a graft 
harvest, but clinical correlation at this site is recommended. 
Subcutaneous edema is present in both extremities (right greater 
than left).

BONE WINDOWS: The osseous structures are unchanged except for 
new sternotomy wires.

IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and moderate atelectasis 
that is new.

2. New ascites and anasarca.

3. Gallbladder sludge.

4. Evaluation of the bowel wall is limited secondary to contrast 
artifact, but there is no portal venous air or obvious bowel 
wall thickening to indicate ischemia.

5. Stable right retroperitoneal hematoma.

6. Right thigh gas that is likely secondary to graft harvest, 
but clinical correlation recommended. 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**4-28**] and heparin started. Tamiflu continued for URI/? 
flu. Cipro continued for UTI.  Carotid US showed bilat. ICA < 
40% stenoses.Chest CT done [**5-1**] showed an atrophic kidney and 
coronary and aortic calcifications.Had nausea and vomiting on 
[**5-2**] and vascular consult done to r/o retroperitoneal bleed due 
to prior cath. Hct decreased from 38 to 22 and she c/o 
abd/back/unilateral LE pain. Pt. also became hypotensive with 
SBP in 80's during vasc. exam. Transferred to CSRU for further 
management. CT scan showed retroperitoneal bleed. Emergent right 
femoral arterial repair done [**5-2**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**]. Extubated the 
following morning. Underwent cabg x5 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-4**]. 
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on titrated 
phenylephrine and propofol drips. Became hypotensive later that 
day and epinephrine and levophed drips started.Milrinone and 
insulin drips also started. Acidosis progressively worsened and 
distending abdomen with RUQ tenderness prompted an evaluation by 
general surgery on [**5-5**]. LFTs also continued to rise.CT scan and 
RUQ ultrasound done showing gall bladder edema and sludge, 
ascites, and no obvious portal venous air or bowel ischemia.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] elected to take the pt. to the OR for exploratory 
laparoscopy to definitively rule out ischemia and a diagnosis of 
gangrenous cholecystitis was made. Converted to open 
cholecystectomy with significant bleeding due to hepatic 
congestion and coagulopathy.Abdomen tense with decreasing urine 
output and increasing ventilatory requirements noted the 
following morning.She developed atrial flutter/fib and was seen 
by the EP service.Abdomen opened at the bedside for 
decompression and washout on [**5-6**].She developed right hand and L 
leg ischemia on [**5-7**] while on continuing pressor support, and 
vasc. surgery re-consulted. On [**5-7**] exploratory lap done by gen. 
surgery and partial colectomy done for ischemia. She developed 
ATN and thrombocytopenia. Renal and hematology consults done 
with diagnosis of DIC and liver failure. IV Amiodarone started 
for recurrent arrhythmias per EP. She remained critically ill on 
significant pressor support.

Epinephrine drip restarted [**5-9**] for additional support and CVVH 
started. Pt. returned to OR for completion right colectomy and 
ileostomy on [**5-9**]. She had a brief period of asystole in surgery. 
Prognosis grim with multi-system organ failure. She required 
increasing pressors and lactic acid rose to 19 on [**5-11**]. She went 
into PEA and pacer unable to capture. No resuscitation 
performed. Expired at approx. 5:55 AM and pronounced by Dr. 
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

     CHEST X-RAY FROM [**4-29**]
     
     HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.  Preop for CABG.
     
     PA and lateral views of the chest show small right pleural effusion.  There is
     some suggestion of hyperinflation with mildly depressed hemidiaphragms and
     slight prominence of the AP diameter of the chest.  No focal parenchymal
     consolidation is seen or any nodules evident.  Calcified atherosclerotic
     plaque is seen in the coronary arteries and thoracic aorta and the origins of
     the great vessels to the head and neck.  Cardiac size is normal and no
     pulmonary vascular congestion or edema is evident.  Thoracic vertebral bodies
     have maintained height and alignment.  Dense contrast (barium) is seen in the
     splenic flexure.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1.  Atherosclerosis including calcified plaque in the coronary arteries.
     2.  No edema or pneumonia.
     3.  Right pleural effusion (versus unfolding of costophrenic angle related to
     pleural thickening and diaphragmatic depression).

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  73-year-old woman, preoperative evaluation to rule out
     carotid artery stenosis.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the cervical level of
     bilateral carotid and the vertebral arteries.
     
     Mild plaques are noted at the proximal portion of bilateral internal carotid
     artery and left common carotid artery.  On the right, the peak systolic
     velocities at ICA, CCA, ECA are 90, 61, and 93 cm/sec, giving a ratio of 1.5
     between ICA and CCA.  On the left, the peak systolic velocities at ICA, CCA,
     ECA are 53, 69, and 77 cm/sec, giving a ratio of 0.77 between ICA and CCA.
     
     There is antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery.  The left vertebral
     artery was not visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild plaques at the bilateral internal carotid artery with
     estimated stenosis less than 40%.

     INDICATION:  Nausea and vomiting.
     
     There were no prior radiographs for comparison.
     
     Oral contrast is present within nondistended colon.  Air and contrast are seen
     throughout the colon with air visualized in the rectosigmoid region.  There is
     no evidence of intestinal obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.
     
     Diffuse vascular calcifications are noted as well as degenerative changes in
     the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.  At the
     time of this dictation, a CT abdomen has been performed and is dictated
     separately.  Please see report of that exam under clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) 7217**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  73-year-old woman with right lower quadrant pain status post
     cardiac catheterization, on anticoagulation.  Also with elevated white blood
     cell count and positive urinalysis.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Limited comparison to chest CT of [**2900-5-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Initial non-contrast axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis
     were obtained.  These were followed by CT images with oral and intravenous
     contrast. Following the initial CT images without contrast, a retroperitoneal
     hematoma and atrophic left kidney were noted.  These findings were discussed
     with the referring team, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and it was decided to proceed with post-
     contrast scan because of suspicion of pyelonephritis.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are dependent changes
     at the bases, and a small amount likely peripheral atelectasis in the right
     middle lobe.  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.
     
     There are multiple hypoattenuating foci in the right kidney which are less
     than 1 cm in diameter and are most likely represent simple cysts, although
     they are too small to characterize.  A larger lesion measures 2.7 x 1.8 cm and
     shows no enhancement consistent with a simple cyst.  There is also a
     hypoattenuating parapelvic cyst of 21 mm in diameter.  It is probably not
     enhancing, and likely also represents a cyst. Posterior thinning of the right
     posterior cortex is noted. The left kidney is atrophic with a delayed
     nephrogram. A hypoattenuating focus in the left kidney of 1.4 cm in diameter
     is probably a cyst.  Two smaller subcentimeter foci are too small to
     characterize. There are no focal perfusion abnormalities to suggest
     pyelonephritis. The stomach, small and large bowel are unremarkable. There is
     no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.
     
     There is expansion and hematoma within the right iliac and psoas muscles with
     multiple areas with fluid-fluid levels consistent with acute hematomas, with
     surrounding inflammatory change surrounding the right iliacus muscle. Although
     the right iliac artery courses adjacent to this area, no active extravasation
     is seen in the deep pelvis.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     In the right groin as well, there is a lesion of 2 cm in diameter with fluid-
     fluid level consistent with an acute hematoma. Following contrast
     administration, contrast layers in the lower portion of the right groin
     hematoma and others in the pelvis, within multiple areas, consistent with
     ongoing bleeding.
     
     There is also a small focus of extraluminal contrast near the hematoma in the
     right groin, probably extravasation of contrast into the muscle lateral to the
     right external iliac artery and vein.  This is the largest single focus of
     extravascular contrast.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The uterus, bladder, sigmoid, and rectum
     are unremarkable.  There is a Foley catheter in the bladder.  There is some
     presacral stranding, probably tracking of hemorrhagic products into the
     posterior pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Moderately large right retroperitoneal hematoma with continuing
     extravasation of contrast into hematomas with multiple fluid-fluid levels.
     2. Appearance is associated with a more nodular area of extravasation near a
     hematoma in the right groin of 2 cm in diameter.  Contrast is not seen on
     these images to emanate directly from the right iliac artery or vein but
     ultrasound could be helpful to exclude a pseudoaneurysm that is leaking.
     3. Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys, probably simple cysts,
     although many are too small to characterize.
     4.  Atrophic left kidney with delayed excretion.
     
     The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] shortly after the study.

     posterior pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Moderately large right retroperitoneal hematoma with continuing
     extravasation of contrast into hematomas with multiple fluid-fluid levels.
     2. Appearance is associated with a more nodular area of extravasation near a
     hematoma in the right groin of 2 cm in diameter.  Contrast is not seen on
     these images to emanate directly from the right iliac artery or vein but
     ultrasound could be helpful to exclude a pseudoaneurysm that is leaking.
     3. Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys, probably simple cysts,
     although many are too small to characterize.
     4.  Atrophic left kidney with delayed excretion.
     
     The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] shortly after the study.

     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are new moderate sized bilateral pleural
     effusions with bilateral atelectasis that is moderate in severity.  Patient is
     status post recent CABG with chest tubes in the mediastinum.  The liver
     enhances homogeneously.  There is a small amount of ascites.  The density of
     the gallbladder is increased suggesting sludge.  There is minimal
     pericholecystic fluid.  The common bile duct is not clearly seen but does not
     appear dilated.  The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, stomach, are unchanged from
     [**2900-5-2**].  The small bowel loops are normal caliber.  Examination of the
     small bowel wall is somewhat limited secondary to artifact from previous
     contrast in the colon, but there is no evidence for pneumatosis or small bowel
     wall thickening.  There is no portal venous air.  A large heterogeneous
     retroperitoneal structure representing a hematoma is unchanged in size from
     [**2900-5-2**].
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a new ascites in the pelvis.  There is
     evidence for anasarca throughout the soft tissues.  Evaluation of the large
     bowel wall is somewhat limited due to artifact from retained contrast.  The
     bowel is caliber is normal.  Evaluation for pneumatosis and bowel wall
     thickening is limited.  The distal ureters and bladder are normal.  A Foley is
     present in the bladder.  Air is present throughout the medial and anterior
     compartment of the thigh.  This is likely secondary to a graft harvest, but
     clinical correlation at this site is recommended.  Subcutaneous edema is

     INDICATION:  73-year-old woman with abdominal pain, right lower quadrant,
     status post cardiac catheterization and elevated lactate and white blood cell
     count.  Please evaluate for ischemic bowel.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2900-5-2**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was
     compared to [**2900-5-2**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are new moderate sized bilateral pleural
     effusions with bilateral atelectasis that is moderate in severity.  Patient is
     status post recent CABG with chest tubes in the mediastinum.  The liver
     enhances homogeneously.  There is a small amount of ascites.  The density of
     the gallbladder is increased suggesting sludge.  There is minimal
     pericholecystic fluid.  The common bile duct is not clearly seen but does not
     appear dilated.  The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, stomach, are unchanged from
     [**2900-5-2**].  The small bowel loops are normal caliber.  Examination of the
     small bowel wall is somewhat limited secondary to artifact from previous
     contrast in the colon, but there is no evidence for pneumatosis or small bowel
     wall thickening.  There is no portal venous air.  A large heterogeneous
     retroperitoneal structure representing a hematoma is unchanged in size from
     [**2900-5-2**].
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a new ascites in the pelvis.  There is
     evidence for anasarca throughout the soft tissues.  Evaluation of the large
     bowel wall is somewhat limited due to artifact from retained contrast.  The
     bowel is caliber is normal.  Evaluation for pneumatosis and bowel wall
     thickening is limited.  The distal ureters and bladder are normal.  A Foley is
     present in the bladder.  Air is present throughout the medial and anterior
     compartment of the thigh.  This is likely secondary to a graft harvest, but
     clinical correlation at this site is recommended.  Subcutaneous edema is
     present in both extremities (right greater than left).

     Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Accounting for differences in
     technique, pulmonary vasculature is unchanged.  There is a small right-sided
     pleural effusion.  Left retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis.

     Lucency in the region of the left hemidiaphragm traversed by both a pleural
     drain and nasogastric tube is probably due largely to anterior pneumothorax. 
     Left lower lobe atelectasis is improved.  Upper lungs clear.  Small right
     pleural effusion is stable.  Heart size normal.  Mediastinum midline.  ET tube
     dual-channel left subclavian line, Swan-Ganz catheter and a midline pleural
     drain were in standard placements.

     INDICATION:  Line change.
     
     A left subclavian catheter terminates at the junction of the left
     brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.  There is a new hyperlucency at
     the left lung base, as well as apparent inversion of the left hemidiaphragm,
     concerning for a left basilar pneumothorax with possible component of tension.
     A left chest tube is in place.  Endotracheal tube and Swan-Ganz catheter
     remain in place, with tip of Swan-Ganz catheter projecting in the right upper
     lobe pulmonary artery.  Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm. 
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Right pleural effusion has
     decreased in size and left effusion has resolved.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for left basilar pneumothorax with possible
     component of tension, as communicated by telephone to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5543**] on [**5-10**], 2006.  Pneumothorax could be confirmed with additional right lateral
     decubitus radiograph.

Resp Care
Pt. remains intubated/sedated/on APRV mode and CVVHD. Oxygenation improving t/o shift. Settings weaned slightly (see careview for details) with MV kept at 6.2-6.4L. Abgs on these settings reveal slight metabolic acidemia with hyperoxygenation and normal ph.
Bs: crackles bibasilar, coarse uppers with minimal secreations.
PlaN: continue APRV mode, would recommend waiting 6-8hrs before weaning pressure to allow for equilbration to occur with reduced MAP.If oxygenation continues to trend upwards wean Phigh by 2cmH20 and adjust Phigh accordingly to maintain MV.
