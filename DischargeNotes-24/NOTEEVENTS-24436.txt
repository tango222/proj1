Admission Date:  [**2540-7-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2540-7-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2460-10-26**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbic respiratory arrest status post
ET tube placement.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old man,
without previously documented coronary artery disease, who
presented to [**Hospital 770**] Hospital on [**7-12**] after developing
chest pain while getting an abdominal MRI.  On arrival to
[**Hospital1 770**], he was complaining of chest pain but otherwise was
a poor historian.  Heart rate was 62, blood pressure 151/95,
oxygen saturation 94%.  He was reportedly pain free with
sublingual Nitroglycerin in the Emergency Room.
Electrocardiogram revealed new inferolateral biphasic
T-waves, and the patient was started on Aspirin, Lovenox, and
Nitroglycerin drip, and was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit.

During the hospitalization, the patient ruled in with a peak
CK of 308 on arrival.  The troponin was negative.  On the
morning of [**7-13**], the patient had recurrent chest pain
with deep T-wave inversions inferolaterally.  The patient was
seen by Cardiology and started on Heparin and Aggrastat, with
plans for transfer to [**Hospital6 84**]
for left heart catheterization.

On transport to [**Hospital6 84**], the
patient reportedly was agitated and received 2 g Ativan plus
or minus Morphine Sulfate, but it was not documented
properly.  He was found in the holding area to be minimally
responsive, although hemodynamically stable with spontaneous
respirations.  He was given Narcan without effect.  Arterial
blood gases revealed 7.20, pCO2 of 93, pO2 of 272, on
non-rebreather, consistent with hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  The patient was intubated and taken to the CCU for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for history of syncope,
benign prostatic hypertrophy, and gastroesophageal reflux
disease.

MEDICATIONS:  He was not on any medications at home.  On
transfer he was on Aspirin 325 p.o. q.d., Lopressor 12.5 p.o.
b.i.d., Lipitor 10 p.o. q.d., Lovenox 70, Nitroglycerin drip,
Aggrastat drip, Pepcid 20 p.o. q.d., Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives at home with his wife.  He is a
retired [**Hospital Ward Name **].  He has occasional alcohol use.  Tobacco
history of one pack per week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  He was a thin, elderly man,
intubated and sedated, status post ET tube placement.  Vitals
signs:  Temperature 97.8��, blood pressure 137/71, pulse 76,
assist control at 12, total volume of 600, FI02 100%, PEEP 5.
HEENT:  He was anicteric with pinpoint pupils.  He had marked
jugular venous distention.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
anteriorly and laterally with good air movement bilaterally.
Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Occasional pauses.  S1 and
S2.  Questionable S3.  No murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen:  Soft
and nontender.  Active bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Faint pulses of dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial.  Neurological:  He was sedated.  He
moved all four extremities spontaneously.  He was not
arousable status post ET tube placement.  He did not
withdrawal to pain in the arms.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count was
5.0, hematocrit 33.8, platelet count 240,000; CHEM7 notable
for a creatinine of 1.5, which later dropped to 1.1; CK on
admission was 308, with an MB fraction of 10, index 3.3, the
CK later dropped to 295 and then 263, troponin less than 0.3;
urinalysis was negative.

Electrocardiogram on arrival to [**Hospital1 770**] revealed
questionable atopic atrial beats at 65, left axis deviation,
Q-waves in V1 and V2, left ventricular hypertrophy, and
inferolateral biphasic T-waves.

On arrival to [**Hospital6 84**], he was in
sinus rhythm in the 70s with slight pauses, left anterior
descending with poor R-wave progression, slight biphasic
T-waves inferiorly and laterally.

Chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 770**] per report was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted, and left heart
catheterization was postponed on the day of admission because
the patient was sedated and unable to give consent.  It was
later postponed because of an episode of hemoptysis late
Thursday night into early Friday morning.

Left heart catheterization was finally done on [**2540-7-18**].  This revealed mildly elevated left ventricular and
diastolic pressure.  Left ventriculography revealed global
hypokinesis, with an ejection fraction of 40%.  Codominant
anatomy with left main coronary artery patent, left anterior

descending with minimal irregularity, left circumflex with
minimal luminal irregularity, and right coronary with
proximal 40% lesion.

Other issues during the hospitalization included agitation in
the patient at times which was treated successfully with
Haldol and a 1:1 sitter.  The patient was initially on
Aggrastat, Heparin drip, and Nitroglycerin drip, and these
were all stopped, and all of his cardiac medications were
discontinued after the left heart catheterization revealed
insignificant coronary artery disease.  After
catheterization, the right groin site revealed no hematoma
and no bruit.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient is to be discharged either to
home or to a nursing rehabilitation center on no medications,
just as he entered the hospital, with follow-up with his
primary care physician.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain of unknown etiology.  The
patient did not have a myocardial infarction.  The patient
did not have unstable angina.
