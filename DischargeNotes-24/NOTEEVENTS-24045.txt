HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88-year-old Caucasian
male patient with history of carotid stenosis, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia who presented to the emergency
department after a syncopal episode.  The patient was in the
kitchen, sitting in a chair and suddenly lost consciousness.
The patient helped him up and called EMS.  The patient does
not remember the circumstances of the fall and cannot provide
an adequate history.  He does deny chest pain,
lightheadedness, shortness of breath, palpitations.  He also
denies tongue biting and incontinence.  The patient does
endorse a two week history of occasional lightheadedness with
one episode of syncope two weeks prior to admission.  In the
emergency department the patient was evaluated with an
electrocardiogram which is initially read as sinus
bradycardia with multiple premature ventricular contractions.
However, on further evaluation the patient was noted to be in
heart block and was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for
immediate pacemaker placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Carotid stenosis.

""pulmonary fibrosis"" in one lung.

Emphysema in one lung.

Arthritis.

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Metoprolol 25 mg twice a day.
2. Aspirin 81 mg q day.
3. Terazosin 2 mg q day.
4. Celecoxib 100 mg q day.
5. Cyanocobalamin 100 mcg q day.
6. Vitamin E 400 units four times a day.
7. Senna one tablet twice a day.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with his
wife.  He has a 40 pack year smoking history but quit.  The
patient does not drink alcohol and has no history of
intravenous drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 204/70, heart rate 45,
respirations 17, 95% on room air.  In general the patient is
alert, though confused and unable to provide an adequate
history.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Patient has dry mucous membranes.
Oropharynx is clear.  Neck:  The patient is in a head collar
at the time of evaluation.  Lungs:  The patient has bibasilar
crackles but otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart:  Irregular bradycardiac rhythm with a normal S1, S2.
3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right upper
sternal border.  Abdomen:  Normal active bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  The patient has 2+
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally with
no evidence of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

Electrocardiogram:  2 to 1 heart block.  Had an HR rate of 80
and a ventricular rate of 40 beats per minute with a right
bundle branch block and a left anterior fascicular block.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  White blood cells 11.3, hematocrit
38.4, platelets 188, sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 106,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 28, creatinine 1.3, glucose 124, calcium
9.3, phosphate 3.4, mag 2.3.  Urinalysis 5.0/negative
nitrates/negative leukocyte esterase.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Rhythm.  The patient was admitted after a
syncopal episode, found to be in 2 to 1 atrioventricular
block with right bundle branch block and a left anterior
vesicular block on admission electrocardiogram.  The patient
was transferred immediately to the Coronary Care Unit where
he was subsequently transferred for pacemaker placement on
the morning of admission.  The patient's pacemaker placement
was uncomplicated.  He was transferred back to the floor
where he was monitored on Telemetry and noted to be
atrioventricular paced.  The patient was evaluated with a PA
and Lateral chest x-ray on the morning following his
procedure which showed normal electrode replacement.  The
patient's beta-blocker dose was titrated as tolerated by his
blood pressure.  He received three doses of intravenous
Vancomycin after his pacemaker was placed.

Coronary artery disease:  The patient was admitted without a
history of coronary artery disease but given his multiple
cardiac risk factors in addition to his carotid artery
disease, the patient was continued on aspirin and a beta-
blocker, the dose of which was titrated up as tolerated by
his blood pressure.  The patient's LDL was checked and noted
to be 124 with an HDL of 41.  He was started on Atorvastatin.
It is anticipated that the patient's liver function tests and
muscle enzymes will be checked as an outpatient given this
initiation of statin therapy.

Congestive heart failure: The patient was admitted with
evidence of mild failure and chest x-ray but no signs of
overt failure on exam.  The patient was started on a beta-
blocker after his pacemaker was placed.  It is anticipated
that he will be evaluated with an echocardiogram as an
outpatient.

Psych:  The patient was noted to be somewhat confused and
agitated.  During the night throughout his hospitalization
was awake and alert throughout the day.  This was considered
likely secondary to an underlying dementia with sundowning.
The patient was given Seroquel that night p.r.n. to help with
his agitation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  2 to 1 atrioventricular block, status
post pacemaker placement.

Hypertension.

Coronary artery disease.

Dementia.

Obstructive/restrictive disease.

Hypercholesterolemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day.
2. Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
3. Atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q day.
4. Cyanocobalamin 50 mcg p.o. q day.
5. Vitamin E 400 units p.o. q day.
6. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q day.
7. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day p.r.n.
8. Senna 1 tablet p.o. twice a day p.r.n. constipation.
9. Terazosin 2 mg p.o. q h.s.
10.      Seroquel 25 mg p.o. q h.s. p.r.n.
11.      Acetaminophen one to two tablets p.o. q 4 to 6 hours
