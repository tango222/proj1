     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      77 year old woman with trach, restrictive lung disease, now BP 70's, distended
      abdomen, tender, dilated loops abdomen xr, recent cdiff diagnosis.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for perforation, mesenteric ischemia, abscess, toxic megacolon
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Known C. Diff colitis by stool studies.  Hypotensive with
     distended abdomen and dilated loops of bowel on the x-ray.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast images are obtained through the abdomen and pelvis.
     Contrast was not given due to patient's decline in renal function.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  An area of consolidation with air
     bronchograms is seen nondependently in the left lingula. There are trace
     bilateral pleural effusions and small areas of consolidation dependently in
     both bases.
     
     A moderate amount of ascites is seen surrounding the liver and spleen,
     tracking into both pericolic gutters, left greater than right.  No focal
     masses are seen within the liver.  The gallbladder is not clearly seen on this
     noncontrast study.  The patient may have had a cholecystectomy.  The spleen is
     small but otherwise normal- appearing. The pancreas is grossly normal.
     
     Multiple vascular calcifications are seen along the celiac axis, aorta, and at
     the origins of the SMA, renal arteries and [**Female First Name (un) **].  Two calculi are seen within
     the pelvis of the left kidney, one at the base of what appears to be an
     extrarenal pelvis.  There is no overt hydronephrosis.  A circular hypodensity
     that appears to be a simple cyst is seen within the right kidney.
     
     Oral contrast is only seen through to the proximal small bowel.  A bright
     linear density 2 - 2.5 cm in length is seen slong the greater curvature of the
     stomach.  It is not seen on the KUB from eariler today. There is some
     asymmetric thickening just adjacent to this area. Part of the density extends
     inferior to the thickening. No part of this density is seen within the bowel
     lumen.  There are no adjacent air or contrast collections.
     
     Thickened mucosal folds are seen within the duodenum in the proximal jejunum.
     The cecum is borderine distended, measuring 6-9 mm across (depending on axis
     of measurement). However, given the amount of distension, the wall is slightly
     prominent.  The transverse colon measures from 5-7 mm across, and given this
     amount of distension, the wall is also slightly prominent.  The large
     intestine tapers at the splenic flexure to a collapsed descending and sigmoid
     colon.  No free air is seen within the abdomen. No air is seen within the
     bowel wall.  No air is seen within the portal venous system.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The rectum and distal sigmoid colon are
     obscured by artifact from patient's bilateral hip prostheses.  There are no
     pelvic masses or enlarged inguinal lymph nodes.  The bladder is poorly
     visualized.  Multiple nondilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel are also
     seen within the pelvis.  Note is made of generalized anasarca throughout the
     subcutaneous tissues.  Multiple injection granulomas are seen within both
     buttocks.  Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions, but there
     are extensive degenerative changes throughout the pelvis and axial spine.
     
     Coronal reconstructions confirm the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Consolidation suspicious for pneumonia, given air bronchograms in the
     lingula.
     
     2. Metallic density in the region of the wall of the greature curvature of the
     stomach.  This could represent a surgical staple but could also be a foreign
     body.  Surrounding thickening suggests possible microperforation at this
     region.  
     
     3. Mild distension of the cecum in transverse colon.  There is a minimal
     amount of bowel wall thickening that is less than would be expected for a
     patient with C. difficile colitis.  As no IV contrast was adminsitered for
     this study, it is excessively difficult to evaluate for ischemic bowel.  While
     this possibility is unlikely, it cannot be definitively excluded.
     
     4. Mucosal thickening seen within the duodenum and proximal jejunum. This
     could be the result of an inflammatory condition, but also would be consistent
     with patient's generalized anasarca and ascites.
     
     5. Measurements of the cecum and transverse colon do not meet the criteria for
     toxin megacolin.  Additionally, there is no evidence of perforation or
     pneumatosis coli.  There is no evidence of obstruction.
     
     These revised findings were discussed with both the Medicine and Surgical
     house staff.

     INDICATION:  History of C-dif x 1 day.  Now shortness of breath and large
     dilated bowel seen on chest X-ray.  Evaluate for obstruction.
     
     ABDOMINAL FILM, SINGLE VIEW:  Again there is a markedly dilated stomach. There
     is air within loops of small bowel as well as air within the transverse colon
     extending to the splenic flexure.  The large bowel is featureless, suggesting
     possible infection.  No definite air can be identified in the rectum.  No
     free air is seen. No aberrant air is identified. Bilateral hip replacement.
     Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Markedly dilated stomach and with air in the small bowel and at
     least proximal colon.  Distal obstruction cannot be excluded.  The most marked
     dilation is of the stomach, necessitating decompression.
     
     These findings were relayed immediately to the ER physician caring for the

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:
     Hypoxia history of mucus plugging, hypotension.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     AP CHEST:
     The patient had a tracheostomy and a central venous line entering from the
     left with its tip in the SVC. There is a distended stomach and elevation of
     the left hemidiaphragm. There is a small left pleural effusion as well as
     probable left lower lobe collapse. On the right there is also fluid in the
     minor fissure. No definite right effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is
     a density behind the heart as well as the suggestion of an air-fluid level,
     this may be related to hiatal hernia. However this is difficult to discern on
     this radiograph. Osseous structures reveal osteopenia, degenerative changes in
     the left shoulder as well as severe degenerative changes and scoliosis of the
     thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Distended stomach. Elevlation of the left hemidiaphragm. Left lower lobe
     collapse and small left effusion.
     2. No definite evidence of failure. An underlying pneumonia in the left lower
     lobe cannot be excluded.
     3. Appropriate position of central venous line. No pneumothorax.
     
     These findings were relayed to the ED physician caring for the patient.

     AP CHEST:  There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube with

     persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a left small pleural
     effusion.  There is persistent collapse of the left lower lobe.  There is a
     hiatal hernia causing an opacity behind the heart.  The visualized portions of
     lung reveal no definite infiltrate or evidence of failure.  The extreme apices
     are partially obscured by the patient's chin however no definite pneumothorax
     is present.
