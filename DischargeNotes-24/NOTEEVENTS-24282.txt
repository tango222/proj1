                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATIONS:    Metastases and pain.  R/O cord compression.
     
     TECHNIQUE:   The cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine were included.  Sagittal
     multisequence imaging of these regions is provided, as well as axial scans
     through cervical and thoracic areas.
     
     Comparison is made to previous MR examinations of [**2732-8-27**] and [**2732-12-27**].
     
     FINDINGS:   There is abnormal signal within most of the vertebral bodies. Some
     vertebrae demonstrates abnormally decreased T1 and T2 signal. The marrow is
     mottled.
     
     Cervical spine images demonstrate abnormal signal throughout the vertebrae.
     There is increased T2 signal in the C2 vertebral body and dens.  There is no
     clear evidence of vertebral collapse.  There are no soft tissue masses
     associated with the cervical vertebrae.  There are degenerative changes of the
     cervical intervertebral spaces.  At C6-7 there is spinal stenosis due to
     spondylosis.  These findings were present on the previous study of [**2732-8-27**].
     
     The cervical spinal cord is normal in caliber and signal intensity.
     
     Thoracic spinal canal is not narrowed.  The thoracic spinal cord has a normal
     appearance.  All the visualized thoracic vertebrae demonstrate signal
     abnormality.  This is consistent with diffuse bony metastases, as defined on
     previous studies.  There are no associated soft tissue masses appreciated.
     
     The lumbar and sacral vertebrae are abnormal.  The lumbosacral spinal canal,
     however, is not narrowed.  The conus is normal in appearance.  The cauda
     equina also has a normal appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:   There are diffuse bony metastases.  There is no evidence of
     metastatic spinal cord compression at this time.  Please note that there are
     soft tissue abnormalities identified in the thorax.  Clinical correlation is
     recommended.

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year-old
female with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer who
presented to the Emergency Department on the day of admission
with dyspnea and shortness of breath.  She was noted to have
slightly more labored breathing that evening prior to
admission following 2 units blood transfusions earlier that
afternoon.  The patient denied chest pain, fevers or chills,
headache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting per family.  On
the morning of admission the patient was found to be dyspneic
with increased work of breathing, which progressively
worsened over the next several hours.  The patient was
brought to the oncology Clinic.  Initially the patient was
oriented, but became progressively more confused and
lethargic.  In the Oncology Clinic the patient's blood
pressure was 100/60, pulse 84, respiratory rate 32, O2 sat
90%, which decreased to 80% despite being on 15 liters of O2
by nonrebreather mask.  The patient became more increasingly
more somnolent and lethargic and was transferred to the
Emergency Room via EMS.

In the Emergency Department the patient was observed to have
an ineffective agonal breathing.  Blood pressure 160/63.
Heart rate 120.  O2 sat 76% on 100% nonrebreather mask.  The
patient was started on BiPAP with improvement of her O2 sats
98 to 100%.  The patient was empirically treated with 20
intravenous Lasix, Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenous, Flagyl 500
mg intravenous and Ampicillin 1 gram intravenous.  The
patient became transiently hypotensive to 70s/40s, which
responded well to 500 cc normal saline bolus.  The patient's
arterial blood gas was 7.29, 38, 54 and BiPAP of 10/5, FIO2
of 1.  The patient's bicarb was 14 and she was given one amp
of bicarb.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Pancreatic cancer diagnosed in
[**2725**] status post partial Whipple procedure in [**2726**] for
palliative treatment, status post x-ray therapy and resection
of lung nodule, question whether it was metastatic
adenocarcinoma versus new primary.  History of bone
metastasis in [**10/2731**] status post chemotherapy completed
2/2001.  Also status post palliative x-ray therapy to pelvis,
shoulders and thighs.  Diffuse metastases of bone including
spine.  Status post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy for biliary
obstruction.  History of ascites and omental mets.
Questionable history of breast cancer.  Questionable history
of primary lung cancer.  Also history of diabetes, recent
history of urinary tract infection.  Klebsiella pneumonia
treated with Cipro.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Megace, Methadone,
Neurontin, Naprosyn, Insulin, Prozac, Prilosec, _______,
Fentanyl patch, Ativan, Dilaudid, Cipro.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with husband.  She
continues to smoke one and a half packs a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.9.  Pulse 101.  Blood
pressure 100/60.  Respirations 20, sating 98% on BiPAP 10/5,
FIO2 of 1.  In general, the patient is stuporous, not
responsive to voice, minimally arousable to sternal rub.
HEENT sclera icteric.  Pupils equally round and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Neck supple with no
lymphadenopathy.  Chest with bilateral expiratory wheezes and
coarse inspiratory rhonchi.  Cardiovascular normal S1 and S2.
Tachycardic.  No rubs or gallops.  Abdomen slightly
distended.  No masses, nontender.  No rebound or guarding.
Skin warm extremities well perfuse.  Positive jaundice on
torsos.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurological Babinski down going bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was elevated at
24.9, hematocrit 35.7.  Differential was 86% neutrophils, 11%
lymphocytes, 2 monos.  INR was elevated at 1.7.  The patient
had normal liver function tests, elevated LDH at 356,
alkaline phosphatase 2188, total bili 7.8.  She also had
troponin and CK leak and elevated lactate at 5.8.  Bedside
echocardiogram was negative for pericardial effusion.  Chest
x-ray showed reticular nodular pattern interstitial with
superimposed multifocal ___________ consolidations consistent
with infection or adult respiratory distress syndrome.  Chest
CT revealed no evidence for PE positive for diffuse reticular
nodular pattern consistent with lymphangitic spread of
carcinoma.  Also left greater then right air space
consolidation consistent with pneumonia or other alveolar
process.  Head CT on [**2733-3-24**] was negative for metastases.
MRI of the spine on [**2733-3-24**] showed diffuse bony metastases.
MRI of the abdomen on [**2733-2-21**] showed no evidence of recurrent
tumor within postop region, positive for ascites and positive
for bone metastases.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis [**2733-2-20**]
showed numeral pulmonary nodules at the lung bases
bilaterally, positive for pneumophila, positive for ascites
with nodular component concerning for omental metastases.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with new right
bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  It was the patient's wishes to not be
intubated, so she was continued on BiPAP ventilatory support.
She was also continued on broad spectrum antibiotics for
presumed sepsis/ARDS including Vancomycin, Flagyl and
Levaquin.  The patient was rehydrated with intravenous
fluids.  Throughout the night the patient's respiratory
status became increasingly tenuous.  After further discussion
with the family the patient was made DNR/DNI and comfort
measures only.  The patient expired at 4:40 a.m. on [**2733-3-30**] from respiratory arrest secondary to sepsis/ARDS in
the setting of a patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

The family is requesting postmortem evaluation.  The family
was present at the time of death.  Attending was notified.
Oncologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was also notified.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of pancreatic and lung cancer with metastatic disease,
     acute shortness of breath, rule out PE.
     
     Comparison is made to prior study of CT chest on [**2732-11-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest with IV contrast.  3D reconstruction images were
     then performed.  100 cc of Optiray was administered intravenously for fast
     bolus CTA.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST (PE PROTOCOL):  Soft-tissue windows again reveal a mass
     lesion in the right prevascular space, measuring approximately 2.3 x 2.3 cm in
     size.  There are also bilateral hilar lymph nodes.  There are no pleural
     effusions.  There are no filling defects in the pulmonary arteries suggestive
     of pulmonary embolism.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels appear
     unremarkable.
     
     Lung windows reveal diffuse reticular interstitial thickening involving all of
     the lung lobes with superimposed alveolar ground glass opacifications.
     Innumerable nodules are also present in both lungs, predominantly in the lung
     periphery.  There are multifocal areas of more conglomerate air-space
     consolidations, most predominantly in the left lower lobe.
     
     Bone windows reveal multiple areas of sclerotic changes in the ribs and spine,
     consistent with metastatic disease.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No evidence of PE.
     
     2) Diffuse reticular interstitial disease with ground glass air-space
     opacification and innumerable peripheral nodules, suggestive of lymphangitic
     carcinomatosis.  There are multiple more conglomerate air-space
     consolidations, most predominantly in the left lower lobe.  This could
     represent superimposed pneumonia or ARDS.
     
     3) Right prevascular mediastinal nodal mass reported before is again
     visualized.
     
     4) Multiple osseous metastatic foci.
     
     The above findings were discussed with Emergency Room house staff upon
     completion of the study.
                                                                 (Over)
