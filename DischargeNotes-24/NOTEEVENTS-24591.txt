HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 77-year-old man
with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**3029-6-30**], who presented to the Emergency Department on the
night of [**8-30**] complaining of a three day history of
chest pain and worsening shortness of breath.  He also
reported increasing oxygen requirement at home.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**3029-6-30**] status
post [**1-3**] cycles of Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **].  His last treatment 2.5 weeks
prior to admission, on home oxygen.
2. Seizure disorder.
3. Status post right hemicolectomy for a benign tumor in '[**24**].
4. IHSS.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the cardiac
catheterization (see below), it was determined by enzymes
that the patient sustained an acute myocardial infarction,
however, he remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
hospital stay.  The patient was initially admitted to the CCU
after his complaints of chest pain, worsening shortness of
breath, and an EKG revealing sinus tachycardia with a right
bundle branch block pattern, right axis deviation, and ST
depressions in the inferolateral leads.  It was suspected
that patient had cardiac tamponade.  He was taken to the
catheterization laboratory and right heart catheterization
revealed no effusion, normal right heart pressures.

On his first day of admission, he dropped his hematocrit from
35 to 17 and his stool was guaiac positive.  He was
transferred from the CCU to the MICU after he was intubated
secondary to hypoxia.

Patient was in the ICU for approximately two weeks at which
point there were daily attempts made to wean patient from the
ventilator.  However, he continued to have an increased
oxygen requirement likely secondary to worsening metastatic
lung cancer as well as what was identified to be pneumonia
from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Unfortunately, instead of clinically improve despite multiple
attempts at weaning from the vent while on the appropriate IV
antibiotics for his infection, these attempts were
unsuccessful.  After multiple family meetings, it was
determined that the patient would not like to go on like
this, and the decision was made on [**9-14**] to
discontinue the ventilator and extubate the patient.  He
passed away a few hours after this was done.

In terms of his GI bleed after one or two blood transfusions,
hematocrit stabilized, and the decision was made for no
intervention.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer leading
to respiratory failure.

     FINDINGS:  In the interval, an ET tube has been placed, with tip 6 cm above
     the carina,  just above the thoracic inlet.  An NG tube is present with tip in
     the stomach.  Surgical clips are noted at the GE junction.  Since the previous
     exam, patchy air-space consolidation within the right upper and mid-lung zones
     as well as the left mid-lung zone has dramatically worsened.  There is no
     pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are

     FINDINGS: The ETT and NG tube remain in unchanged and satisfactory position.
     There has been interval placement of pulmonary artery catheter entering via
     the IVC, with tip in the main pulmonary artery. The heart size and mediastinal
     contours are unchanged. Diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities in the mid
     and lower lung zones to a lesser extent the upper lung fields bilaterally
     demonstrate slight improvement. Underlying diffuse nodular opacities are
     unchanged. The previously seen right upper lobe confluent opacification shows
     significant partial resolution. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.
     Surgical clips once again noted in the lower mediastinum. The visualized
     osseous structures are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION: Resolving right upper lobe pneumonia, and resolving acute
     interstitial process. No change in underlying nodular opacities consistent
     with lymphangitic spread of lung cancer.

     INDICATION: Weight loss, upper abdominal pain and known non small cell lung
     cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices through the pubic symphysis, following the administration of 150
     cc of intravenous Optiray.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are innumerable pulmonary nodules
     scattered throughout the lung fields, predominantly involving the lung apices.
     There is a 4 x 2.4 cm mass in the right hilar region, with spiculated edges.
     In addition superimposed on the extensive nodules there is patchy and somewhat
     confluent opacity involving the inferior right upper lobe and superior left
     lower lobe. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is a small
     pericardial effusion. The heart is of normal size but there is a Swan-Ganz
     catheter extending into the left main pulmonary artery. Extensive athero-
     sclerotic changes are noted throughout the aorta. No definite central
     pulmonary arterial filling defects are noted. There are scattered
     paratracheal, prevascular and subcarinal lymph nodes. The largest is noted in
     the right paratracheal region, measuring up to 1 cm.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver timing is suboptimal but there
     are no definite hepatic lesions. The gallbladder is not identified. There is a
     polypoid mass in the gastric fundus region. The pancreas, adrenal glands and
     kidneys are grossly unremarkable with nonspecific perinephric stranding. There
     are several low attenuation foci throughout the spleen, probably representing
     early arterial artifact. There is no free air or gross ascites. Extensive
     vascular calcifications are noted throughout the aorta and iliac arteries.
     There are scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which do not
     meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. The visualized loops of bowel are
     grossly unremarkable, allowing for slight limitations related to respiratory
     artifact.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, prostate and urinary bladder
     are unremarkable. Scattered sigmoid diverticulae are noted, without evidence
     of diverticulitis. No free pelvic fluid or deep pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     The osseous structures demonstrate lucent changes within the sacrum and in the
     iliac bone and superior pubic rami.

     There is a 4 x 2.4 cm mass in the right hilar region, with spiculated edges.
     In addition superimposed on the extensive nodules there is patchy and somewhat
     confluent opacity involving the inferior right upper lobe and superior left
     lower lobe. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is a small
     pericardial effusion. The heart is of normal size but there is a Swan-Ganz
     catheter extending into the left main pulmonary artery. Extensive athero-
     sclerotic changes are noted throughout the aorta. No definite central
     pulmonary arterial filling defects are noted. There are scattered
     paratracheal, prevascular and subcarinal lymph nodes. The largest is noted in
     the right paratracheal region, measuring up to 1 cm.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver timing is suboptimal but there
     are no definite hepatic lesions. The gallbladder is not identified. There is a
     polypoid mass in the gastric fundus region. The pancreas, adrenal glands and
     kidneys are grossly unremarkable with nonspecific perinephric stranding. There
     are several low attenuation foci throughout the spleen, probably representing
     early arterial artifact. There is no free air or gross ascites. Extensive
     vascular calcifications are noted throughout the aorta and iliac arteries.
     There are scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which do not
     meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. The visualized loops of bowel are
     grossly unremarkable, allowing for slight limitations related to respiratory
     artifact.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, prostate and urinary bladder
     are unremarkable. Scattered sigmoid diverticulae are noted, without evidence
     of diverticulitis. No free pelvic fluid or deep pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     The osseous structures demonstrate lucent changes within the sacrum and in the
     iliac bone and superior pubic rami.
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1. Innumerable pulmonary nodules with superimposed consolidations in the right
     upper and left lower lobes. This is consistent with diffuse metastatic
     disease. Superimposed infection in the areas of consolidation cannot be
     excluded
     2. Extensive atherosclerotic changes.
     3. Diffuse osteopenic changes throughout the pelvis.
     4. Possible gastric fundal mass, although this could represent a prominent
     fold during peristalsis. Further evaluation with upper GI should be
     considered if clinically indicated.

     VIEWS:  A single AP portable semi-upright view, comparison dated [**3029-9-5**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal venous
     access catheter remain in stable and satisfactory position.  Again seen are
     diffuse bilateral nodular opacities consistent with history of metastatic
     spread.  The previously seen focal infiltrate in the right upper lobe is
     probably not significantly changed allowing for differences in patient
     positioning.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
     pleural effusions.  Metallic surgical clips in the midline overlying the upper
     abdomen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral nodular densities consistent with metastatic
     spread of tumor, and no significant change in appearance of right upper lobe
     consolidation.  Lines and tubes in stable position.

     Pneumonia.  Change in mental status.  Evaluate for bleed and mets.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Pre and post contrast CT of the head.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no parenchyma or extraaxial hemorrhage.  There is no shift
     of normally midline structures or mass effect.  The [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-white distinction is
     preserved and the ventricles, cisterns and sulci are within normal limits.
     There are two very small areas of focal enhancement in the right cerebral
     hemisphere at the [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-white junction, one in the frontal lobe anteriorly on
     series 4, image 24, and one in the anteroparietal lobe on series 4, image 23.
     These are both on the right.  There are no definite additional foci of
     abnormal enhancement.  There is no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement
     appreciated.  The patient is intubated and there are prior secretions in the
     pharynx.  The bones demonstrate polypoid ossific lesion in the left frontal
     sinus which probably represents an osteoma.  The mastoid air cells are
     completely opacified bilaterally.  There is also fluid in the middle ear
     cavity on the left extending into the eustachian tube.  These findings may
     relate to intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Two very small foci of abnormal enhancement in the right cerebral
     hemisphere which may represent metastatic deposits.  MRI may be able to better
     demonstrate these lesions and could perhaps unveil additional lesions not
     visualized using CT.
     Probable osteoma in the region of left frontal sinus, please exclude [**Location (un) 3969**]

     hemisphere at the [**Doctor Last Name 66**]-white junction, one in the frontal lobe anteriorly on
     series 4, image 24, and one in the anteroparietal lobe on series 4, image 23.
     These are both on the right.  There are no definite additional foci of
     abnormal enhancement.  There is no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement
     appreciated.  The patient is intubated and there are prior secretions in the
     pharynx.  The bones demonstrate polypoid ossific lesion in the left frontal
     sinus which probably represents an osteoma.  The mastoid air cells are
     completely opacified bilaterally.  There is also fluid in the middle ear
     cavity on the left extending into the eustachian tube.  These findings may
     relate to intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Two very small foci of abnormal enhancement in the right cerebral
     hemisphere which may represent metastatic deposits.  MRI may be able to better
     demonstrate these lesions and could perhaps unveil additional lesions not
     visualized using CT.
     Probable osteoma in the region of left frontal sinus, please exclude [**Location (un) 3969**]
     syndrome.
