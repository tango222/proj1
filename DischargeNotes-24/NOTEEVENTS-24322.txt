temporal stroke.  He has been on Coumadin for an AVR for 20
years and confusion started the morning of admission.  No
complaints of vomiting, headache, and transferred to [**Hospital1 930**] from [**Hospital3 **] for further
management.

On physical exam, his temperature was 99.1.  Heart rate is
63.  Blood pressure 153/70.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Sats

His reflexes were within normal limits.  Cardiovascular:  Has
S1, S2 with mechanical click.  Pulmonary:  Bilaterally clear.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.

Head CT scan showed large interventricular blood with
interparenchymal component in the occipital region.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for
close monitoring.  The patient was seen by the Cardiology
Service, who recommended stopping his anticoagulation
secondary to the bleed and he was on Coumadin for his AVR.

starting aspirin in 10 days after bleed.

no drift.  Full strength in all extremities, but continued to
be disoriented.  Patient was transferred to the regular

was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and
found to require rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Zantac 150 mg po bid.
2. Hydralazine 10 mg IV q six hours prn to keep his systolic
blood pressure less than 140.
3. Tylenol 650 po q four hours prn.

The patient was in stable condition at the time of discharge

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      80 year old man with intraventricular bleed in lateral ventricles found on CT
      at [**Hospital6 1538**] [**1-25**].  Patient is inattentive, confused but alert.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HEAD CT [**3378-1-25**].
     
     HISTORY:  Follow-up intraventricular hemorrhage.
     
     There are no prior studies available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast imaging was performed from the skull base
     through the vertex.
     
     CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of high attenuation
     material within the left lateral ventricle representing hemorrhage.  The
     occipital [**Doctor Last Name 79**] of the lateral ventricle appears expanded.  A small amount of
     high density material is also seen dependently within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 79**] of
     the right lateral ventricle.  The ventricles are somewhat prominent in
     comparison to the sulci.  Multiple areas of periventricular low attenuation
     are seen likely representing chronic microvascular ischemia.  There is no
     shift of normally midline structures.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, left greater than right.
     Comparison to previous outside study is recommended to evaluate for
     progression.

     COMPARISONS: [**3378-1-24**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Again noted is high attenuation material in the occipital horns of
     both lateral ventricles representing hemorrhage.  This appearance is unchanged
     in the interval since prior exam.  The ventricles remain somewhat prominent
     relative to cerebral sulci, and are unchanged in the interval. No parenchymal
     hemorrhage is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, left greater than right
     with prominence of ventricles relative to the cerebral sulci- ? early
     commmunicating hydrocephalus. No significant change since prior study.  See
     previous report for detailed description.
