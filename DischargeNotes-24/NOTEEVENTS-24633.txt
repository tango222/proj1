     INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are no old films available for comparison.  The cardiac
     silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is increased density at both bases
     suggesting infiltrate which may be secondary to fluid overload although an
     infectious etiology can't be totally excluded.  There are Kerley B lines and
     bilateral pleural effusions.  The vasculature is hazy.
     
     IMPRESSION:  CHF.  Underlying infectious etiology can't be totally excluded.

Admission Date:  [**2688-10-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2688-10-31**]

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the discharge summary,
starting on [**10-27**].

On [**10-27**], the plan to delay transfer to
rehabilitation was made when the patient developed a burst of
supraventricular tachycardia.  This resolved without any
intervention.  The decision was made to start the patient on
Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day and replete magnesium.  The
patient was to remain with a pacer box, given some
bradycardia when previously dosed with Lopressor.

On postoperative day number six, the patient had complained
about some palpitations the prior evening.  She had a little
bit of atrial flutter.  She was given some Diltiazem which
resolved it.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a heart rate of 72 and
in sinus rhythm and maintained a good blood pressure,
saturating 93% on one liter.  Heart was otherwise regular in
rhythm.  The lungs were clear bilaterally.  The wounds were
clean, dry and intact.  The patient was stable.  The
Lopressor was increased with plans to watch and reset the
pacer if necessary and the Diltiazem drip was discontinued.

On postoperative day number seven, the patient had no
complaints and was in sinus rhythm at 75.  Blood pressure was
150/73 with a T maximum of 98.6.  The patient's lungs were
clear bilaterally.  The incisions were clean, dry and intact.
Belly was soft.

The patient had a run of rapid atrial fibrillation earlier in
the day.  Lopressor was increased and continued at 50 mg
twice a day with a good blood pressure. The patient continued
some Oxycontin SR with good pain control and the patient's
heart rhythm was watched again for another 24 hours.

The patient continued to work with physical therapy.  The
patient converted to sinus rhythm at 8:30 in the morning and
remained in sinus rhythm in the 60's and 70's.  Lopressor was
increased to 75 twice a day.  Some Procainamide was started.
The patient also received some Benadryl for an itch and a
rash that was noted all over her body and continued to get
some pain medications.

At 6 o'clock the next morning, some intravenous Lopressor was
given again and some Diltiazem was given also for atrial
fibrillation in the 130's.  On postoperative day number
eight, the patient had no complaints, was back in sinus
rhythm in the 70's, maintaining good blood pressure of
146/80.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  Pacing wires remained
in. Wounds were clean, dry and intact.  The right lower
extremity wound was also clean, dry and intact.  The patient
continued to be stable and continued on heparin.  Coumadin
was started.  Pacing wires were removed.  Lopressor was
continued as was the Procainamide which was 500 mg twice a
day.

On postoperative day number nine, the patient had no
complaints.  She had a T max of 98.1, rate in the 60's and
sinus rhythm; blood pressure of 153/60.  Saturating 96% on
room air. Lungs were clear bilaterally.  All incisions were
clean, dry and intact.  The abdomen was soft.  The heparin
was discontinued the night prior.  Pacing wires were
discontinued.  The patient maintained sinus rhythm overnight.

The Lopressor was decreased from 75 mg twice a day back to 50
mg twice a day.  The patient slept all night, had a little
bit of Percocet for pain and remained in sinus rhythm.  The
patient was re-evaluated by physical therapy and on [**10-31**], postoperative day number nine, the patient was
discharged to rehabilitation in [**Location (un) 954**].

The patient was taking some long-acting Oxycontin to go to
rehabilitation for pain.  Electrocardiogram was repeated.
Electrocardiogram was within normal limits.  Procaine level
was not back yet.  The patient was given a Procaine dose in
the morning prior to transfer to rehabilitation.  Mediastinal
chest tube site sutures were removed and, on the 4th, the
patient was discharged to the rehabilitation facility in [**Location (un) 5754**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  As previously listed:
1.) Status post coronary artery bypass grafting, times four.
2.) Status post atrial fibrillation.
3.) Status post myocardial infarction.
4.) Congestive heart failure.
5.) Hypertension.
6.) Nephrolithiasis.
7.) Tuberculosis.
8.) Pott's disease.
9.) Anemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  As noted prior, with the addition of:
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.

The patient was given instructions to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] four weeks post discharge and also to follow-up
with primary care physician in one to two weeks, following
discharge to the rehabilitation facility.

NOTE:  This is an addendum.  Please refer to the discharge
summary dictated on [**10-27**], for admission from
[**10-22**] through [**10-27**].  This is the addendum
from [**10-27**] to [**10-31**].  Today is [**2689-1-8**].

      80 year old woman with cabg                                                     
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o effusion

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  S/P CABG, ? effusion.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared with 1 month prior.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval CABG, with sternotomy wires present.  There
     has been significant interval improvement in the interstitial changes
     previously seen, particularly on the right side. However, there has been
     interval development of a retrocardiac opacification, as well as bilateral
     pleural effusions (left greater than right).  There are persistent atelectatic
     changes at the right lung base.  Calcification of the aorta is noted.  The
     cardiac silhouette is stable.  No focal pulmonary opacities, pleural
     effusions, or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.  Incidental
     note is made of a hiatal hernia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Interval improvement of bilateral interstitial changes, right
     greater than left.
     
     2)  Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate in size on
     the left and tiny on the right.
     
     3)  Retrocardiac collapse/consolidation is silghtly worse than on the prior
     study.
