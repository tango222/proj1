Admission Date:  [**3058-11-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**3058-11-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2989-12-7**]     Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA [**Last Name (un) **]

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the Discharge Summary
dictated on [**3058-11-8**].

Initial disposition plan was to send Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6382**] to
rehabilitation in order to receive Physical Therapy; however,
it took some time to find a rehabilitation slot for this
gentleman.  Over the next several days, Physical Therapy
continued to evaluate and treat the patient and found his
ambulation improved such that he did not require inpatient
rehabilitation.  In conjunction with case management,
Physical Therapy felt that discharge to home with home
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy would be
appropriate for him.

In the interim, Addiction Services came to see the patient.
They spoke with him extensively about alcohol treatment
programs.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6382**] was amenable to seeking treatment for
his alcohol abuse, however, his insurance did not cover
inpatient programs in his home area.

Addiction Services found him several day program options
close to his home that would be suitable for him.  He was
given the numbers to contact said programs.

On the morning of [**11-11**], the patient developed a fever
to 101.7 F.; at that time his blood pressure was 140/60;
heart rate 94; respiratory rate 18.  He remained awake and
alert with clear breath sounds.  The only change in his
examination was asymmetric one to two plus pitting edema of
the left lower extremity with tenderness anteriorly over the
tibia.  There was no posterior tenderness or cords palpable.
He had palpable pulses, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
in that foot.

To work-up his fever, blood cultures as well as urinalysis
and urine cultures were taken.  Urinalysis had negative
nitrite and leukocyte esterase and did not indicate urinary
tract infection.  CBC showed a normal white blood cell count
of 6.0.  Chest x-ray was negative for infiltrate to suggest a
pneumonia.

He had a left ankle film that was taken the night before
which showed no fracture or dislocation or effusion in the
joint.  He was given a gram of Ancef to cover him for
cellulitis.  A rheumatology consultation was called in case
this represented a flare of his gout in the ankle and lower
extremity Dopplers were ordered which were negative for deep
vein thrombosis.

Rheumatology came to see the patient and felt that this was
not joint involved, but rather soft tissue inflammation.  He
was continued on Ancef until the point of discharge, at which
point he was switched to Keflex for presumed cellulitis as
the source of the fever.

Cultures remained no growth to date at the time of discharge.

Other laboratory work taken on the 16th showed an apparent
decrease in hematocrit from 29 to 25.  However, this was
shown to be laboratory error.  Repeat testing showed a
hematocrit of 29, stable for the previous five days.  His
coagulations remained normal.

The patient was discharged the following day on [**11-12**],
to home, with services provided, including Physical Therapy
and Occupational Therapy.  He was placed on a ten day course
of Keflex for presumed left lower extremity cellulitis and
given a prescription for Vioxx for joint pain which he has
taken previously.

He was afebrile and ambulatory at the time of discharge and
tolerating p.o. well.

He was sent out with the recommendation to follow-up with
Neurosurgery Clinic for his history of traumatic subarachnoid
hemorrhage in two weeks and given the number for a clinic
appointment.

He was informed that he had a probable right shoulder rotator
cuff tear and would need MRI as an outpatient to follow-up
for that injury.  He declined to have MRI while in the
hospital and therefore will need outpatient follow-up.

He has an Orthopedic doctor in his home town and would prefer
to follow-up with that doctor.  He left with information to
follow-up with outpatient day programs for alcohol treatment.
Prior to his leaving, I spoke with primary care physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3700**], [**Location (un) 6383**], [**State 427**], with
[**Hospital **] Medical Group.  I explained his hospital course and
explained to both the patient and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3700**] that he would
need a follow-up appointment with his primary care physician
next week.

We discussed the need to re-examine the left lower extremity
to establish resolution of the cellulitis.  We also discussed
his relative anemia.  The patient has previously received
extensive work-up for anemia and his primary care physician
feels that that number is both consistent with his prior
results and indicative of liver disease from ETOH
consumption.

The patient was instructed to continue his home medication
regimen with the exception of Coumadin.  I explained to him
that he needed to not take his Coumadin for at least the next
six weeks and then be re-evaluated by his physician prior to
restarting that medication secondary to his traumatic
subarachnoid.

He was sent home with a prescription for Keflex 500 four
times a day for ten days as well as Vioxx 12.5 p.o. q. day.

     INDICATION: 68 year old man who is intoxicated and fell down stairs.  He is on
     Coumadin.  Evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage.  He has a known subarachnoid
     hemorrhage seen at an outside hospital.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.

     the left temporoparietal lobe and layering in the sylvian fissure compatible
     with subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is a small amount of interventricular
     blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 79**].  Additionally there is a small amount of
     high attenuation material along the epindymal layer of the left lateral
     ventricle seen on image 18.  This may be within the posterior portion of the
     corpus callosum.  The ventricles are not dilated.  The sulci are not effaced.
     There is no evidence of herniation.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: There is no skul fracture.  The paranasal sinuses are normally
     pneumatized.
     
     IMPRESSION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage and interventricular hemorrhages as
     described above.  No evidence of skull fracture.

     INDICATION:  Follow up intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISONS: [**3058-11-5**]
     
     FINDINGS: There has been no significant change compared to the prior study.
     Again demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage within the left temporal parietal
     region extending into the sylvian fissure. The small amount of
     intraventricular blood within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 79**] is unchanged. There is
     loss of the normal sulcation within the left temporal and parietal lobes
     consistent with edema.  The degree of edema is unchanged compared to the prior
     study.  There is no shift of normally midline structures.  The ventricles are
     not dilated.  Again demonstrated is a tiny hemorrhage within the midline
     adjacent to the septum pellicudum likely within the posterior portion of the
     corpus callosum.  This is unchanged in size. The area of increased attenuation
     within the left temporal lobe extends into the white matter regions and may
     represent intraparenchymal contusion.
     
     The osseous structures and visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There is no significant change in the appearance of the left
     temporal parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is no change in the size of
     the intraventricular hemorrhage.  There is mild edema within the left temporal
     and parietal lobes with loss of the normal sulcation. The appearance is
     unchanged compared with [**3058-11-5**].
