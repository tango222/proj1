Resp: Vent settings 100% IMV 700 x12 ABG was 391/30/7.49.  She was suctioned for a small amount of tan blood tinged secretions that was just bearly enough for a C&S.  Breath sound coarse throughout but following suctioning she became very bronkospastic so MDI's were ordered.  Vent changed to A/C 600 x12 FiO2 60% at 1500.  

Cardiac: B/P 130-140-60's, HR 80's SR but when agitated B/P 160-170/70.  She was started on an ativan gtt at 1mg/hr with good effect.

GU: Foley in place draining good amount of light yellow urine.  She received 1l NS in the ED and when she arrived at the unit she had 1800cc of light yellow urine.  

GI:  No NGT as of yet but promote with fiber can be started at 10cc/hr advancing to a goal of 65cc/hr (as per dietary).  Abd soft and non tender.  (+) BS.

Neuro: Pt mostly sedated since arrival.  She received a total of 8mg MSO4 and ativan 4mg in the EW with intubation and immediately following.  She remains mostly sedated but with periods of agitation which required an ativan bolus and the ativan gtt..

Lines:  She arrived with an #18A in left hand and an A-line right radial.  A central line and NGT will be placed by the HO.

Plan: Repeat ABG following vent change, placement of NGT and start tube feedings, central line placement and follow-up chest Xray.

  Neuro:  Propofol gtt weaned off at 0800--initially pt calm, but she quickly became agitated, moving all extremities, intermittantly following commands, opening eyes spontaneously only occasionally.  Plan to tollerate agitation in hopes of extubation today--pt medicated with haldol for aggitation and ? delerium (pt mouthing that she wants to ""get out"" despite frequent reorientation to place).  Even at end of day, pt responding to family members by nodding, but she continues to have depressed mental status--her eyes are not open and she falls asleep when not stimulated (except during periods of generalized agitation). 
  CV: With first PSV trial, pt became tachycardic (120's) and hypertensive (170's)--ST segment depressions evident on monitor.  12-lead done and pt with ischemic changes--team aware, trial d/c'd and pt resedated pending titration up of cardiac meds.   Lopressor increased to 50 mg TID and captopril increased to 12.5 mg TID--after these medications administered, pt with BP consistantly in 140's and HR consistantly 90-100.  ST changes resolved with decreased rate.  Pt diuresed today--NFB = 1.5 liters out.  Lytes after diuresis WNL except K+=3.8-->40 Meq Kcl repleted IV per order.

Secretions moderate to large (another possible barrier to successful extubation) of thick white/clear.

Pt. remains sedated on propofol and on PS ventilation. Goal to maximize cardiac function and attempt a trial of weaning.

Neuro: PT. received on propofol at 10mcg/kg/min, pt. continued to be restless, coughing of ett, moving in the bed which would cause her to be tachypnic. Propofol initally increased to 15mcg/kg/min then 20 and currently at 17mcg/kg/min. She continues to move her legs and takes off pulse ox, but does not obey commands. She appears more comfortable on this dose of propofol. Pupils reactive to light.

Resp: Intially on PS 15+5 40%. Tidal volumes in the 300's, rate in the teens to 20's. This am noted to have increased work of breathing that did not resolve with suctioning, also ?ekg changes at this time. PS increased to 20. PT. appears much more comfortable on Ps 20. AM abg wnl. Suctioned for thick, white secretions.

CV: Bp stable, SBP 100's-140's.  NSR, no ectopy noted. Although did have ?st segment depressions this am. ekg done, per HO no further changes, tolerating increased lopressor dose, and HR in the 90's and increased captopril dose. CVP 5-6.

  Neuro:  Propofol gtt weaned off at 0800.  Pt initially agitated on SBT--responded well to 2 mg IV haldol.  After extubation, pt only A + O X 1 but following commands consistantly and opening eyes/tracking spontaneously.  Mental status gradually improving throughout day--pt now A + O X 2, some agitation continues--pt moving around in bed but she suffers from chronic backpain for which motrin works well.  400 mg PO administered at 1800.  
  CV:  BP management has been major issue today.  Pt continues on lopressor 50 mg TID and captopril 25 mg TID--even on this regimen BP remained elevated.  In setting of global hypokinesis and EF =20%, NTG added and was to be titrated to keep SBP around 110.  Initially, gtt was effective, but through afternoon BP continued to rise despite maxing gtt out at 3.5 mcg/kg/min.  One dose 0.625 mg IV enalapril administered at 1700 with minimal result. NGT placed for PO meds--after 1800 lopressor, pt with ABP 130's, NBP 120's.  Lasix administered twice today for goal out of 2 liters (40 mg at 10 am and 80 mg at 1745).  Combination of diuresis, nitrates, lopressor and captopril now compromises regimen.  
  Pulm:  Pt trialed onn PSV 5/5 for one hour--on these settings pt with RR around 30 and TV around 300.  She also did a 25 minute Tpiece trial with acceptable ABG and no s/sx flash PE.  Pt extubated to 40% CSM per team at 1100am.  Negative stridor, +BBS, +vocalization(weak). Pt initially was NTS for moderate amts thin clear secretions, then her cough become more effective and she is able to clear her own secretions with encouragement.  Fi02 increased to 50% to maintain sats despite pulm toilet/sxn. Pt tachypneic with audible exp wheeze since extubation.  With exertion her RR is in 40's and she has difficulty speaking more than [**1-23**] words.  Despite her poor clinical appearance, her ABG has remained stable. Latest lung exam reveals crackles throughout (posteriorally). Team has evaluated her multiple times and hope is to diurese her more and control her BP to prevent possible reintubation. Plan to check ABG at 1800 and start bipap if it has worsned. Will monitor carefully for fatigue, continue pulm toilet and send ABG as indicated.  
  GI:  In setting of tachypnea, it was felt pt should be kept strictly NPO including meds.  Per her sister, pt has difficulty swallowing pills at baseline.  A NTG was placed and confirmed for use by CXR for meds.  
  Endo:  Fingersticks covered q 6 hours with ssri--at 1800, FS=226, covered with 4 u regular (NGT mixed in D5W).
