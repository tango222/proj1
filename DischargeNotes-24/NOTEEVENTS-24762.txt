     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old man with severe 3V CAD, pre op for CABG                             
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o pulmonary process

                                     FINAL REPORT
     TWO VIEW CHEST [**2702-7-7**] WITH NO PRIOR FILMS FOR COMPARISON.
     
     INDICATION:  Preoperative assessment for coronary bypass surgery.
     
     The heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits as
     well as the pulmonary vascularity.  There are coarse reticular opacities at
     the right lung base.  The lungs otherwise appear clear and there are no
     pleural effusions.  Degenerative changes are observed in the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Coarse reticular opacities in the periphery of the right lung
     base of uncertain chronicity but probably related to chronic
     scarring/fibrosis. No definite similar findings are seen in the left lower
     lobe.  Given the unilateral distribution, this could represent a sequela of a
     previous infection or area of prior inflammation.  An asymmetrical
     distribution of chronic interstitial lung disease is also possible,
     particularly if the patient has been experiencing chronic dyspnea and dry
     cough.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 78 year old patient of Dr.
[**Known patient firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 786**], referred to [**Hospital1 73**] for an outpatient cardiac catheterization, which was
done on [**2702-7-7**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Catheterization done at [**Location (un) 1405**] [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2688-11-29**], revealed a totally
occluded left anterior descending coronary artery near the
apex and a totally occluded circumflex with collaterals 70 to
80 percent sequential mid right coronary artery and 70
percent proximal posterior descending coronary artery lesion.
There was inferior wall akinesis and moderately severe
anterolateral wall hypokinesis.  After discussion, it was
decided to treat the patient medically and he has been
asymptomatic since [**2688**].  The patient reports that he has
done well, active, walking several miles per day, denies any
chest pain, although he does report having some shortness of
breath while climbing stairs and carrying anything heavy such
as groceries.  Myoview done [**2702-7-3**], the patient exercised
to 86 percent heart rate.  It was positive for chest pain and
lateral ST changes with fixed inferior posterolateral defect,
extensive anterior and apical ischemia and an ejection
fraction of 27 percent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Diabetes mellitus.

Neuropathy.

Cholecystectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. NPH insulin 40 units in the a.m. along with 3 units of
   regular insulin and NPH insulin 30 units along with 6
   units of regular in the p.m.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
3. Amitriptyline 25 mg q.h.s.
4. Niaspan 1000 mg q.h.s.
5. Toprol 150 mg once daily.
6. Fish Oil 1000 mg three times a day.
7. Lasix 40 mg once daily.
8. Lisinopril 20 mg once daily.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Widower who lives alone in elderly housing.
He has two daughters.  He denies tobacco use, stopped smoking
twenty-five years ago.  Occasional alcohol use and no
recreational drug use.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.5, hematocrit
44.0, platelet count 91,000.  Sodium 133, potassium 3.5,
chloride 99, bicarbonate 26, blood urea nitrogen 30,
creatinine 1.3.  INR 1.0.

Cardiac catheterization showed three vessel coronary artery
disease with moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction and
mildly elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure.
Left main had a large aneurysm at the bifurcation but no
angiographically apparent flow limiting stenosis.  The left
anterior descending coronary artery had a 50 percent
midvessel stenosis after the aneurysm and 80 percent distal
vessel lesion was occluded at the most distal portion.
Diagonal one had a 50 percent ostial stenosis.  The left
circumflex was occluded proximally.  The obtuse marginal
branches filled via left collaterals.  The right coronary
artery was occluded in the midportion and filled via bridging
and left to right collaterals.  The ejection fraction was 34
percent.  Left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 20.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was referred to Cardiothoracic
Surgery and was seen and accepted for surgery and scheduled
as an outpatient with surgery planned for [**2702-7-17**], with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 14**].  On [**2702-7-17**], the patient was admitted as a
postoperative admission directly to the operating room.
Please see the operating room report for full details.  In
summary, the patient had coronary artery bypass grafting
times three with the left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
the posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein
graft to the diagonal and mitral valve repair with a number
28 annuloplasty band.  The patient's bypass time was 132
minutes with a cross clamp time of 87 minutes.  He tolerated
the operation well and was transferred from the operating
room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time
of transfer, the  patient was in sinus rhythm at a rate of
100 beats per minute with a mean arterial pressure of 83 and
a central venous pressure of 16.  He had Dobutamine at 3
mcg/kg/minute and Propofol at 20 mcg/kg/minute.  The patient
additionally had Levophed infusing to maintain a mean
arterial blood pressure of 60.  The patient was somewhat
hypoxic in the immediate postoperative period, requiring a
slow wean from the ventilator.  The patient was ultimately,
however, reversed from his anesthesia,weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  Additionally on the
day of surgery, the patient was noted to have atrial
fibrillation and was begun on an Amiodarone infusion.  On
postoperative day number one, the patient was hemodynamically
stable.  Electrophysiology was consulted as the patient was
felt to be in atrial fibrillation but occasionally had
episodes of first and second degree heart block.  His
Dobutamine infusion was weaned off during the course of
postoperative day number one.  Over the next two days, the
patient was in and out of atrial fibrillation.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout that period.  On
postoperative day number three, his chest tubes were removed,
and he was begun on Heparin drip for his atrial fibrillation.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 290**] Two for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next
several days, the patient had an uneventful postoperative
course.  His activity level was increased with the assistance
of the nursing staff and physical therapy staff.  He
continued to be seen by the Electrophysiology service, but
ultimately converted into a normal sinus rhythm.  On
postoperative day number five, it was decided that the
patient would be stable and ready for transfer to a
rehabilitation center on the following day.  At the time of
this dictation, the patient's physical examination is as
follows:  Vital signs revealed temperature 96, heart rate 79,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 125/60, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 97 percent in room air, weight
preoperatively 83 kilograms and at discharge is 86.2
kilograms.  Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count
12.9, hematocrit 32.3, platelet count 174,000.  Prothrombin
time 16.5, INR 1.8.  Sodium 131, potassium 4.3, chloride 94,
CO2 26, blood urea nitrogen 35, creatinine 1.3, glucose
219,000.  Neurologically, the patient is awake, alert and
oriented times three, moves all extremities, follows
commands.  Respiratory is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, sternum is
stable.  Incision with Steri-strips, open to air, clean and
dry.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused with no edema.  Left lower extremity incision with
Steri-strips, open to air, clean and dry.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. once daily.
2. Aspirin 81 mg once daily.
3. Amiodarone 400 mg twice a day times one week and then 400
   mg once daily.
4. Metoprolol 25 mg twice a day.
5. Colace 100 mg twice a day.
6. Plavix 75 mg once daily times one month.
7. Captopril 12.5 mg three times a day.
8. Lasix 40 mg q.a.m.
9. Potassium Chloride 20 mEq q.a.m.
10.      Warfarin titrated to a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.  He
   received 5 mg on [**2702-7-21**], and 2 mg on [**2702-7-22**].
   Recommended dose to be provided on day of transfer.
11.      Insulin NPH 20 units in the a.m. along with 3 units
   of regular and NPH 15 units in the p.m. along with 3 units
   of regular.  Additionally, the patient gets regular
   insulin on a sliding scale four times a day.
12.      P.r.n. medications include Tylenol 650 mg q4hours
   and Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets q4hours p.r.n.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting times three with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to diagonal and also

     FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are within
     normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates slight upper zone
     redistribution, improved from the previous examination.  Small bilateral
     pleural effusions, unchanged.  Improved patchy left lower lobe atelectasis. No
     focal pulmonary parenchymal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  Sternal sutures
     and mediastinal clips consistent with prior CABG.  Stable appearance of
     deformity of the right clavicle consistent with healing fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Improved congestive heart failure.
     
     2)  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     3)  Improving patchy atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
